Part I: Dedication 
 
Again you show yourselves, you wavering Forms, 
Revealed, as you once were, to clouded vision. 
Shall I attempt to hold you fast once more? 
Heart’s willing still to suffer that illusion? You crowd so near! Well then, you shall endure,      5 And rouse me, from your mist  and cloud’s confusion: 
My spirit feels so young again: it’s shaken  
By magic breezes that your breathings waken. 
 
You bring with you the sight of joyful days, 
And many a loved shade rise s to the eye:     10 
And like some other ha lf-forgotten phrase, 
First Love returns, and Friendship too is nigh: 
Pain is renewed, and sorrow: all the ways, 
Life wanders in its labyrinthine flight, 
Naming the good, those that Fate has robbed     15 
Of lovely hours, those slipped from me and lost.  
They can no longer hear this latest song, 
Spirits, to whom I gave my early singing: That kindly crowd itself is now long gone, Alas, it dies away, that first loud ringing!     20 
I bring my verses to the unknown throng, 
My heart’s made anxious even by their clapping, And those besides delighted by my verse, 
If they still live, are sca ttered through the Earth. 
 I feel a long and unresolved desire      25 
For that serene and solemn land of ghosts: 
It quivers now, like an Aeolian lyre, My stuttering verse, with its uncertain notes, 
A shudder takes me: tear on tear, entire, 
The firm heart feels weaken ed and remote:     30 
What I possess seems far away from me, And what is gone becomes reality.  Part I: Prelude On Stage 
 
(Director, Dramatist, Comedian ) 
 
Director 
 
You two, who’ve often stood by me, 
In times of need, when  trouble’s breaking,  
Say what success our undertaking      35 
Will meet with, then, in Germany? 
I’d rather like the crowd to enjoy it, Since they live and let live, truly. 
The stage is set, the boards complete, 
And they await our festivity.       40 They’re seated already, eyebrows raised, 
Calmly hoping they’ll be amazed. 
I know how to make the people happy: But I’ve never been so embarrassed: not 
That they’ve been used to the best, you see,     45 
Yet they’ve all read such a dreadful lot. How can we make it a ll seem fresh and new, 
Weighty, but entertaining too? 
I’d love to see a joyful crowd, that’s certain, When the waves drive them  to our place,     50 
And with tremendous and repeated surging, 
Squeeze them through the narrow gate of grace: 
In the light of day they’re there already, Pushing, till they’ve reached the window, 
As if they’re at the baker’s, starving, nearly     55 
Breaking their necks: just for a ticket. Oh! Only poets can work this miracle on men  
So various: the day is yours, my friend!   
Dramatist 
 
O, don’t speak to me of that varied crew, 
The sight of whom makes inspiration fade.     60 
Veil, from me, the surging multitude, 
Whose whirling will drives us everyway. No, some heavenly s ilence lead me to, 
Where for the poet alone pure joy’s at play: 
Where Love and Friendship too grace our hearts,    65 
Created and inspired  by heavenly arts. 
 
Ah! What springs here from our deepest being, 
What the shy trembling lips in speaking meant, Now falling awry, and now perhaps succeeding, 
Is swallowed in the fierce Moment’s violence.    70 
Often, when the first years are done, unseeing, 
It appears at last, comp lete, in deepest sense. 
What dazzles is a Momentary act: 
What’s true is left for posterity, intact.  
Comedian 
 
Don’t speak about posterity to me!      75 
If I went on about posterity, 
Where would you get your worldly fun? 
Folk want it, and they’ll still have some. The presence of a fine young man 
Is nice, I think, for everyone.       80 
Who, comfortably, shares his wit, And to their moods takes no exception: 
He’ll make himself a greater hit, 
And win a more secure reception. Be brave, and show them what you’ve got,     85 
Have Fantasy with all her chorus, yes, 
Mind, Reason, Passion, Tears, the lot, But don’t you leave out Foolishness.   
Director 
 
Make sure, above all, pl enty’s happening there! 
They come to look, and then they want to stare.    90 
Spin endlessly before their faces, 
So the people gape amazed, You’ve won them by your many paces, You’ll be the man most praised. 
The mass are only moved by things en masse ,     9 5  
Each one, himself, will c hoose the bit he needs: 
Who brings a lot, brings something that will pass: 
And everyone goes home contentedly. 
You’ll give a piece, why then give it them in pieces! With such a stew you’re destined for success.    100 
Easy to serve, it’s as easy to invent. 
What use to bring them your complete intent? The Public will soon pick at what you’ve dressed. 
 
Dramatist 
 
You don’t see how badly such work will do! 
How little it suits the genuine creator!      105 Already, I see, it’s a principle with you. The finest master is a sloppy worker. 
 
Director 
 
Such a reproach leaves me unmoved: 
The man who seeks to be approved, Must stick to the best tools for it,      110 
Think, soft wood’s the best to split, 
And have a look for whom you write! See, this is one that boredom drives, 
Another’s from some overloaded table, 
Or, worst of all, he’s one arrives,      115 Like most, fresh fro m the daily paper. 
They rush here mindlessly, as to a Masque, 
And curiosity inspires their hurry: 
The ladies bring themselv es, and in their best, Come and play their parts and ask no fee.     120 
What dream of yours is this, exalted verse? 
Doesn’t a full house make you happy? 
Have a good look at your patrons first! One half are coarse, the rest are chilly. 
After the show he hopes for card-play:     125 
He hopes for a wild night, and a woman’s kiss. 
Why then do so many poor fools plague, The sweet Muse, for su ch a goal as this?  
I tell you, just give them more and more, 
So you’ll never stray far from the mark,     130 
Just seek to confuse them, in the dark: 
To keep them happy, that’s hard - for sure. 
And now what’s wrong? Delight or Pain?  
Dramatist 
 
Go, look for another scribbler by night! Shall the poet throw away the highest right,     135 
The right of humanity, that Nature gave, 
Carelessly, so that you might gain! 
How will he move all hearts again? How will each elem ent be his slave? 
Is that harmony nothing, from his breast unfurled,    140 
That draws back into his own heart, the world? When Nature winds the lengthened filaments, 
Indifferently, on her eternal spindle, 
When all the tuneless mass of elements, In their sullen discord, jar and jangle –      145 
Who parts the ever-flowing ranks of creation, 
Stirs them, so rhythmic measure is assured? Who calls the One to general ordination, 
Where it may ring in marvellous accord? 
Who lets the storm wind rage  with passion,     150 
The sunset glow the senses move? 
Who scatters every lovely springtime blossom 
Beneath the footsteps of the one we love? Who weaves the slight green wreath of leaves, To honour work well done in every art?     155 
What makes Olympus sure, joins deities? 
The power of Man, revealed by the bard. Comedian 
 
So use it then, all this fine energy, 
And drive along the work of poetry, To show how we are driven in Love’s play.     160 
By chance we meet, we feel, we stay, 
And bit by bit we’re tightly bound: Happiness grows, and then it’s fenced around: We’re all inflamed then comes the sorrowing: 
Before you know it, there’s a novel brewing!     165 
Why don’t we give such a piece! 
Grasp the life of man complete! 
Everyone lives, though it’ s seldom confessed, 
And wherever you grasp, there’s interest. In varied pictures there’s little light,      170 
A lot of error, and a gleam of right, 
So the best of drinks is brewed, So the world’s cheered and renewed. 
Then see the flower of lovely youth collect, 
To hear your words, and view the offering,     175 And every tender nature will extract 
A melancholy food fr om what you bring, 
They’ll gain now this and that from your art, So each sees what is pr esent in their heart. 
They’re readily moved to weeping or to laughter,    180 
They’ll admire your verve, and enjoy the show: 
What’s finished you can never alter after: Minds still in growth will be grateful, though.  
Dramatist 
 
So give me back that time again, 
When I was still ‘becoming’,       185 
When words gushed like a fountain 
In new, and endless flowing, Then for me mists veiled the world, In every bud the wonder glowed, 
A thousand flowers I unfurled,       190 
That every valley, richly, showed. I had nothing, yet enough: 
Joy in illusion, thirst for truth. 
Give every passion, free to move, The deepest bliss, filled with pain,      195 
The force of hate, the power of love, 
Oh, give me back my youth again!   
Comedian 
 
Youth is what you need, dear friend, 
When enemies jostle you, of course, 
And girls, filled with desire, bend      200 Their arms around your neck, with force, When the swift-run race’s garland 
Beckons from the hard-won goal, 
When from the swirling dance, a man Drinks until the night is old.        205 
But to play that well-known lyre 
With courage and with grace, Moved by self-imposed desire, 
At a sweet wandering pace, 
That is your function, Age,       210 And our respect won’t lessen. 
Age doesn’t make us childish, as they say, 
It finds that we’re still children.  
Director 
 
That’s enough words for the moment, Now let me see some action!       215 
While you’re handing out the compliments, 
You should also make things happen. 
Why talk so much of inspiration? Delay won’t make it flow, you see. 
Since Poetry gave the gift of creation,      220 
Take your orders then from Poetry. You know what’s wanted here, We need strong ale to appear: 
So brew me a barrel right away! 
Tomorrow won’t do what’s undone today,     225 We shouldn’t waste a minute, so 
Decide what’s possible, and just 
Grasp it firmly like a hoe, Make sure that you let nothing go, 
And work it about, because you must.      230 
On the German stage, you see, Everyone tries out what he can: 
Don’t fail to show me, I’m your man, 
Your trap-doors, and your scenery. Use heavenly lights, the big and small,     235 
Squander stars in any number,     
Rocky cliffs, and fire, and water, Birds and creatures, use them all. So in our narrow playhouse waken 
The whole wide circle of creation,      240 
And stride, deliberately, as well, From Heaven, through the world, to Hell. Part I: Prologue In Heaven 
 
(God, the Heavenly Hosts,  and then Mephistopheles. ) 
 (The Three Archangels step forward. ) 
 
Raphael 
 
The Sun sings out, in ancient mode, 
His note among his brother-spheres, 
And ends his pre-determined road,      245 With peals of thunder for our ears. 
The sight of him gives Angels power, 
Though none can understand the way: The inconceivable work is ours, 
As bright as on the primal day.       250 
  
Gabriel 
 
And swift, and swift, beyond conceiving, 
The splendour of the Earth turns round, 
A Paradisial light is interleaving, With night’s awesome profound. The ocean breaks with shining foam,      255 
Against the rocky cliffs deep base, 
And rock and ocean whirl and go, In the spheres’ swift eternal race. 
 
Michael 
 
And storms are roaring in their  race 
From sea to land, and land to sea,      260 Their raging forms a fierce embrace,  
All round, of deepest energy. 
The lightning’s devastations blaze Along the thunder-crashes’ way: Yet, Lord, your messengers, shall praise     265 
The gentle passage of your day. All Three 
 
The sight of it gives Angels power 
Though none can understand the way, And all your noble work is ours, 
As bright as on the primal day.       270 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Since, O Lord, you n ear me once again, 
To ask how all below is doing now, And usually receive me without pain, 
You see me too among the vile crowd. 
Forgive me: I can’t speak in noble style,     275 And since I’m still reviled by this whole crew, 
My pathos would be su re to make you smile, 
If you had not renounced all laughter too. 
You’ll get no word of suns and worlds from me. 
How men torment themselves is all I see.      280 
The little god of Earth sticks  to the same old way, 
And is as strange as on that very first day. 
He might appreciate life a little more: he might, 
If you hadn’t lent him a gleam of Heavenly light: He calls it Reason, but only uses it      285 To be more a beast than any beast as yet. 
He seems to me, saving Your Grace, 
Like a long-legged grasshopper: through space He’s always flying: he f lies and then he springs, 
And in the grass the same old song he sings.     290 
If he’d just lie there in the grass it wouldn’t hurt! But he buries his nose in every piece of dirt. 
 
God 
 
Have you nothing else to name?  
Do you always come here to complain? Does nothing ever go right on the Earth?     295  
Mephistopheles 
 
No, Lord! I find, as always, it couldn’t be worse. I’m so involved with Man’s wretched ways, 
I’ve even stopped plaguing them, myself, these days. 
 
God 
 
Do you know, Faust? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
The Doctor? 
 
God 
  My servant, first! 
 
Mephistopheles  
 
In truth! He serves you in a peculiar manner.     300 
There’s no earthly food or drink at that fool’s dinner. 
He drives his spirit outwards, far, Half-conscious of its maddened dart:  From Heaven demands the brightest star, 
And from the Earth, Joy’s highest art,      305 
And all the near and all the far, Fails to release his throbbing heart. 
 
God 
 
Though he’s still confused at how to serve me, 
I’ll soon lead him to a clearer dawning, In the green sapling, can’t the gardener see     310 
The flowers and fruit the coming years will bring.  
Mephistopheles 
 
What do you wager? I might win him yet! 
If you give me your permission first, 
I’ll lead him gently on the road I set. 
 
God 
 
As long as he’s alive on Earth,       315 
So long as that I won’t forbid it, For while man strives he errs. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
My thanks: I’ve never willingly seen fit 
To spend my time amongst the dead, I much prefer fresh cheeks instead.      320 
To corpses, I close up my house: 
Or it’s too like a cat  with a mouse.  
 
God 
 
Well and good, you’ve sa id what’s needed! 
Divert this spirit from his source, 
You know how to trap him, lead him, 
On your downward course,       325 And when you must, then stand, amazed: 
A good man, in his darkest yearning, 
Is still aware of virtue’s ways.  
Mephistopheles 
 
That’s fine! There’s hardly any waiting.     330 
My wager’s more than safe I’m thinking. 
When I achieve my goal, in winning, You’ll let me triumph with a swelling heart. He’ll eat the dust, and with an art, 
Like the snake my mother, known for sinning.    335 
   
God 
 
You can appear freely too: Those like you I’ve never hated. 
Of all the spirits who deny, it’s you, 
The jester, who’s most lightly weighted.  Man’s energies all too soon seek the level,     340 He quickly desires unbroken slumber, 
So I gave him you to join the number, 
To move, and work, and play the devil. But you the genuine sons of light, 
Enjoy the living beauty bright!       345 
Becoming, that works and lives forever, Embrace you in love’s limits dear, 
And all that may as Appearance waver, 
Fix firmly with everlasting Idea!  
(Heaven closes, and the Archangels separate.)  
 Mephistopheles  (alone ) 
 
I like to hear the Old Man’s wo rds, from time to time,   350 
And take care, when I’m with him, not to spew. 
It’s very nice when su ch a great Gentleman, 
Chats with the devil, in ways so human, too! Part I Scene I: Night 
 
(In a high-vaulted Gothic chamber, Faust, in a c hair at his desk, restless. ) 
 Ah! Now I’ve done  Philosophy, 
I’ve finished Law and Medicine,      355 
And sadly even Theology: Taken fierce pains, from end to end. 
Now here I am, a fool for sure! 
No wiser than I was before: 
Master, Doctor’s what they call me,      360 And I’ve been ten years, already, 
Crosswise, arcing, to and fro, 
Leading my students by the nose, And see that we can know - nothing! 
It almost sets my heart burning.       365 
I’m cleverer than all these teachers, 
Doctors, Masters, scribes, preachers: 
I’m not plagued by doubt or scruple, 
Scared by neither Hell nor Devil – Instead all Joy is snatched away,      370 
What’s worth knowing, I can’t say, 
I can’t say what I should teach To make men better or convert each. 
And then I’ve neither goods nor gold, 
No worldly honour, or splendour hold:     375 
Not even a dog would play this part! So I’ve given myself to Magic art, 
To see if, through Spirit powers and lips, 
I might have all secrets at my fingertips. And no longer, with rancid  sweat, so,      380 
Still have to speak what I cannot know: 
That I may understand whatever Binds the world’s innermost core together, 
See all its workings, and its seeds, 
Deal no more in words’ empty reeds.       385 O, may you look, full moon that shines, On my pain for this last time: 
So many midnights from my desk, 
I have seen you, keeping watch: When over my books and paper,      390 
Saddest friend, you appear!       
Ah! If on the mountain height 
I might stand in your sweet light, Float with spirits in mountain caves, 
Swim the meadows in twilight’ waves,     395 
Free from the smoke of knowledge too, Bathe in your health-giving dew! Alas! In this prison must I stick? 
This hollow darkened hole of brick, 
Where even the lovely heavenly light      400 Shines through stained glass, dull not bright. 
Hemmed in, by heaps of books, 
Piled to the highest vault, and higher, Worm eaten, decked with dust,  
Surrounded by smoke-blackened paper,     405 
Glass vials, boxes round me, hurled,       Stuffed with Instruments thrown together, 
Packed with ances tral lumber – 
This is my world! And what a world! 
And need you ask why my heart      410 
Makes such tremors in my breast? 
Why all my life-energies are Choked by some unknown distress? Smoke and mildew hem me in, 
Instead of living Nature, then,       415 
Where God once created Men, Bones of creatures, and dead limbs! 
Fly! Upwards! Into Space, flung wide! 
Isn’t this book, with secrets crammed, From Nostradamus’ very hand,       420 
Enough to be my guide? 
When I know the starry road, And Nature, you instruct me, 
My soul’s power, you shall flow, 
As spirits can with spirits be.       425 Useless, this dusty pondering here  To read the sacr ed characters: 
Soar round me, Spirits, and be near: 
If you hear me, then answer!  
(He opens the Book, and sees th e Symbol of the Macrocosm ) 
 
Ah! In a moment, what bliss flows      430 Through my senses from this Sign! 
I feel life’s youthful, holy joy: it glows, 
Fresh in every nerve and vein of mine. This symbol now that calms my inward raging,  Perhaps a god deigned to write,       435 
Filling my poor heart with delight, 
And with its mysterious urging Revealing, round me, Nature’s might? 
Am I a god? All seems so clear to me! 
It seems the deepest works of Nature      440 Lie open to my soul, with purest feature. 
Now I understand what wise men see: 
“The world of spirits is not closed: Your senses are: your heart is dead! 
Rise, unwearied, disciple: bathe instead     445 
Your earthly breast in the morning’s glow!”  
(He gazes at the Symbol .) 
 How each to the Whole its selfhood gives, One in another works and lives! 
How Heavenly forces fall and rise, 
Golden vessels pass each other by!      450 Blessings from their wings disperse:   
They penetrate from Heaven to Earth, 
Sounding a harmony through the Universe! Such a picture! Ah, alas! Merely a picture! 
How then can I grasp you endless Nature?     455 
Where are your breasts that  pour out Life entire, 
To which the Earth and Heavens cling so, 
Where withered hearts would drink? You flow 
You nourish, yet I languish so, in vain desire.  (He strikes the book indignantly, and catches sight of the Symbol 
of the Earth-Spirit .) 
 How differently it works on me, this Sign!     460 
You, the Spirit of Earth, are nearer: 
Already, I feel my power is greater, 
Already, I glow, as with fresh wine.  I feel the courage to engage the world, 
Into the pain and joy of Earth be hurled,     465 
And though the storm wind is unfurled, Fearless, in the shipwreck’s  teeth, be whirled.  
There’s cloud above me – 
The Moon hides its light – 
The lamp flickers! Now it dies! Crimson rays dart       470 
Round my head – Horror  
Flickers from the vault above, And grips me tight! 
I feel you float around me,       475 
Spirit, I summon to appear, speak to me! Ah! What tears now at  the core of me! 
All my senses reeling 
With fresh feeling! I feel you draw my whole heart towards you!    480 
You must! You must! Though my Life’s lost, too! 
 (He grips the book and speaks the myster ious name of the Spirit. A crimson 
flame flashes, the Spirit appears in the flame. ) 
 
Spirit 
 
Who calls me? 
 Faust (Looking away ) 
 
Terrible to gaze at! 
 
Spirit 
 
Mightily you have drawn me to you, 
Long, from my sphere, snatched your food, 
And now – 
 Faust 
 
   A h !  Endure you, I cannot!    485 
 
Spirit 
 
You beg me to show myself, you implore, 
You wish to hear my voice, and see my face: The mighty prayer of your soul weighs 
With me, I am here! – What wretched terror 
Grips you, the Superhuman! Where is your soul’s calling?  490 Where is the heart that made a world inside, enthralling: 
Carried it, nourished it, swolle n with joy, so tremulous, 
That you too might be a Spirit, one of us? Where are you, Faust,  whose ringing voice 
Drew towards me with all your force?      495 
Are you he, who, breathing my breath, Trembles in all your life’s depths, 
A fearful, writhing worm? 
 
Faust 
 
Shall I fear you: you form of fire? I am, I am Faust: I am your peer!      500  
Spirit 
 
In Life’s wave, in action’s storm, 
I float, up and down, 
I blow, to and fro! Birth and the tomb, 
An eternal flow,         505 
A woven changing, A glow of Being. 
Over Time’s quivering loom intent, 
Working the Godhead’s living garment.  
Faust 
 
You who wander the world, on every hand,     510 Active Spirit, how close to you I feel! 
 
Spirit 
 
You’re like the Spirit that you understand 
Not me! 
 (It vanishes. ) 
 
Faust  (Overwhelmed ) 
 Not you? 
Who then?          515 
I, the image of the Godhead!        Not even like you? 
 
(A knock .) 
 
Oh, fate! I know that sound – it’s my attendant – 
My greatest fortune’s ruined! In all the fullness of my doing,       520 
He must intrude, that arid pedant! 
 (Wagner enters, in gown and nightcap, la mp in hand. Faust turns to him 
impatiently .) 
 
Wagner 
 
Forgive me! But I heard you declaim: 
Reading, I’m sure, from some Greek tragedy? To profit from that art is my aim, 
Nowadays it goes down splendidly.      525 
I’ve often heard it claimed, you see A priest could learn from the Old Comedy. 
 
Faust 
 
Yes, when the priest’s  a comedian already: 
Which might well seem to be the case. 
 Wagner 
 
Ah! When a man’s so penned in his study,     530 
And scarcely sees the world on holidays, And barely through the gl ass, and far off then, 
How can he lead men, through persuading them? 
 
Faust 
 
You can’t, if you can’t feel it, if it never 
Rises from the soul, and sways        535 The heart of every single hearer, 
With deepest power, in simple ways. 
You’ll sit forever, gluing things together, Cooking up a stew from other’s scraps, 
Blowing on a miserable fire,       540 
Made from your heap of dying ash. Let apes and children praise your art, 
If their admiration’s to your taste, 
But you’ll never speak from heart to heart, Unless it rises up from your heart’s space.       545  
Wagner 
 
Still, lecturing brings orators success: I feel that I am far behind the rest. 
 
Faust 
 
Seek to profit honestly! 
Don’t be an empty tinkling fool! 
Understanding, and true clarity,       550 Express themselves without art’s rule! 
And if you mean what you say, 
Why hunt for words, anyway? Yes, your speech, that glitters so, 
Where you gather scraps for Man,      555 
Is dead as the mist-filled winds that blow Through the dried-up leaves of autumn! 
 
Wagner 
 
Oh, God! Art is long 
And life is short. Often the studies that I’m working on      560 Make me anxious, in my head and heart. 
How hard it is to command the means 
By which a man attains the very source! Before a man has trave lled half his course, 
The wretched devil has to die it seems.     565 
 
Faust 
 
Parchment then, is that your holy well, 
From which drink always slakes your thirst? 
You’ll never truly be refreshed until 
It pours itself from your own soul, first.  
Wagner 
 
Pardon me, but it’s a great delight      570 
When, moved by the spirit of the ages, we have sight 
Of how a wiser man has thought, and how 
Widely at last we’ve spread his word about.  
Faust 
 
Oh yes, as widely as the constellations! 
My friend, all of the ages that are gone     575 
Now make up a book with seven seals. 
The spirit of the ages, that you find, In the end, is the spirit of Humankind: 
A mirror where all the ages are revealed. 
And so often it’s all a mere misery      580 Something we run away from at first sight. 
A pile of sweepings, a lumber room, maybe 
At best, a puppet show, that’s bright With maxims, excellent, pragmatic, 
Suitable when dolls’ mouths wax dramatic!     585 
 
Wagner 
 
But, the world! Men’s hearts and minds! 
Something of those, at least, I’d like to know.  
Faust 
 
Yes, what men choose to understand! 
Who dares to name the child’s real name, though? 
The few who knew what might be learned,       590 
Foolish enough to put their whole heart on show, 
And reveal their feelings to the crowd below, 
Mankind has always cruc ified and burned.  
I beg you, friend, it’s now the dead of night, We must break up this conversation.      595 
 Wagner 
 
I would have watched with you, if I might 
Speak with you still, so learned in oration. But tomorrow, on Easter’s first holy day, 
I’ll ask my several questions, if I may. 
I’ve pursued my work, zealously studying:     600 There’s much I know: yet I’d know everything.  (He leaves .) 
 
Faust  (Alone .) 
 
That mind alone never loses hope, 
That keeps to the shallows eternally, Grabs, with eager hand, the wealth it sees, 
And rejoices at the worms for which it gropes!    605 
Dare such a human voice echo, too, Where this depth of Spirit surrounds me? 
Ah yet! For just this once, my thanks to you, 
You sorriest of all earth’s progeny! You’ve torn me away from that despair,     610 
That would have soon ove rwhelmed my senses. 
Ah! The apparition was so hugely there, It might have truly dwarfed my defences. 
I, image of the Godhead, already one, 
Who thought the spirit of eternal truth so near,    615 
Enjoying the light, both heavenly and clear, Setting to one side the earthbound man: 
I, more than Angel, a free force, 
Ready to flow through Nature’s veins, And, in creating, enjoy the life divine,      620 
Pulsing with ideas: must atone again! 
A word like thunder swept me away. I dare not measure myself against you. 
I possessed the power to summon you, 
But not the power to make you stay.      625 In that blissful moment, then I felt myself so small, so great: 
Cruelly you hurled me back again, 
Into Man’s uncertain state. What shall I learn from? Or leave?      630 
Shall I obey that yearning? 
Ah! Our actions, and not just our grief, 
Impede us on life’s journey. Some more and more al ien substance presses 
On the splendour that the Mind conceives:     635 
And when we gain what this world possesses, We say the better worl d’s dream deceives.  
The splendid feelings that give us life, 
Fade among the crowd’s earthly strife. 
If imagination flew with courage, once,     640 And, full of hope, stretched out to eternity, 
Now a little room is quite enough, 
When joy on joy has gone, in time’s whirling sea.  Care has nested in the heart’s depths, 
Restless, she rocks there, spoiling joy and rest,     645 
There she works her secret pain, And wears new masks, ever and again, 
Appears as wife and child, fields and houses,  
As water, fire, or knife or poison: Still we tremble for what never strikes us,     650 
And must still cry for wh at has not yet gone. 
I am no god: I feel it all too deeply. I am the worm that writhes in dust: see, As in the dust it lives, and seeks to eat, 
It’s crushed and buried by the passing feet.     655 
Is this not dust, what these vaults hold, These hundred shelves that cramp me: 
This junk, and all the thousand-fold 
Shapes, of a moth-ridden world, around me? Will I find here what I’m lacking else,      660 
Shall I read, perhaps, as a thousand books insist,  
That Mankind everywhere torments itself, So, here and there, so me happy man exists? 
What do you say to me, bare grinning skull? 
Except that once your brain whirled like mine,    665 Sought the clear day, a nd in the twilight dull, 
With a breath of truth,  went wretchedly awry. 
For sure, you instruments mock at me, 
With cylinders and arms, wheels and cogs: I stand at the door: and you should be the key:    670 
You’re deftly cut, but you undo no locks. 
Mysterious, even in broad daylight, 
Nature won’t let he r veil be raised: 
What your spirit can’t bring to sight, 
Won’t by screws and levers be displayed.     675 
You, ancient tools, I’ve never used You’re here because my father used you, Ancient scroll, you’ve darkened too, 
From smoking candles burned above you. 
Better the little I had was squandered,      680 
Than sweat here under its puny weight! 
What from your father you’ve inherited, 
You must earn again, to own it straight. What’s never used, leaves us overburdened, 
But we can use what the Moment may create!    685 
Yet why does that place so draw my sight, Is that flask a magnet for my gaze? 
Why is there suddenly so sweet a light, 
As moonlight in a midnight woodland plays? I salute you, phial of rare potion,      690 
I lift you down, with devotion! 
In you I worship man’s art and mind, Embodiment of sweet sleeping draughts: Extract, with deadly power, refined, 
Show your master all his craft!       695 
I see you, and my pain diminishes, I grasp you, and my struggles grow less, 
My spirit’s flood tide e bbs, more and more,  
I seem to be where ocean waters meet, 
A glassy flood gleams around my feet,     700 
New day invites me to a newer shore.  
A fiery chariot sweeps nearer On light wings! I feel ready, free 
To cut a new path through the ether 
And reach new spheres of pure activity.     705 This greater life, this godlike bliss! You, but a worm, have you earned this? 
Choosing to turn your back, ah yes, 
On all Earth’s lovely Sun might promise! Let me dare to throw t hose gates open,     710 
That other men go creeping by! 
Now’s the time, to prove through action 
Man’s dignity may rise divinely high, Never trembling at that void where, 
Imagination damns itself to pain,      715 
Striving towards the passage there, Round whose mouth all Hell’s fires flame: Choose to take that step, happy to go 
Where danger lies, where Nothingness may flow. 
Come here to me, cup of crystal, clear!     720 Free of your ancient cover now appear, 
You whom I’ve never, for many a year,  
Considered! You shone at ancestral feasts, Cheering the over-serious guests: 
One man passing you to another here.      725 
It was the drinker’s duty to explain in rhyme The splendour of your many carved designs 
Or drain it at a draught, and breathe, in time: 
You remind me of those youthful nights of mine. Now I will never pass you to a friend,      730 
Or test my wits on your art again. 
Here’s a juice will stun any man born: It fills your hollow with a browner liquid. I prepared it, now I choose the fluid, 
At last I drink, and with my soul I bid      735 
A high and festive greeting to the Dawn!  
(He puts the cup to his mouth .) 
 (Bells chime and a choir sings. ) 
 
Choir of Angels 
 
Christ has arisen! 
Joy to the One, of us, Who the pernicious, Ancestral, insidious,         740 
Fault has unwoven. 
 Faust 
 
What deep humming, what shining sound 
Strikes the glass from my hand with power? 
Already, do the hollow bells resound, 
Proclaiming Easter’s festive course? Our     745 
Choirs, do you already sing the hymn of consolation, Which once rang out, in deathly night, in Angels’ oration, 
That certainty of a new testament’s hour?    
 
Chorus of Women 
 
With pure spices 
We embalmed him,        750 We his faithful 
We entombed him: 
Linen and bindings, We unwound there, 
Ah! Now we find         755 
Christ is not here.  
Choir of Angels 
 
Christ has arisen! 
Blissful Beloved, 
Out of what grieved, 
Tested, and healed:        760 His trial is won. 
 
Faust 
 
You heavenly sounds, powerful and mild, 
Why, in the dust, here, do you seek me?  Ring out where tender hearts are reconciled. 
I hear your message, but faith fails me:       765 
The marvellous is fa ith’s dearest child. 
I don’t attempt to rise to that sphere, From which the message rings: 
Yet I know from childhood what it sings, 
And I’m recalled to life once more.      770 In other times a Heavenly kiss would fall 
On me, in the deep Sabbath silence: 
The bell notes filled with presentiments, 
And a prayer was pleasure’s call: A sweet yearning, beyond my understanding,    775 
Set me wandering throug h woods and fields, 
And while a thousand tears were burning I felt a world around me come to be. 
Love called out the lively games of youth, 
The joy of spring’s idle holiday:      780 
Memory’s childish feelings, in truth, Hold me back from the last sombre way. 
O, sing on you sweet songs of Heaven! 
My tears flow, Earth claims me again! 
 
Chorus of Disciples 
 
Has the buried one         785 
Already, living, 
Raised himself, alone, Splendidly soaring: 
Is he, in teeming air, 
Near to creative bliss:        790 Ah! In sorrow, we’re Here on Earth’s breast. 
Lacking Him, we  
Languish, and sigh. Ah! Master we         795 
Cry for your joy! 
 
Choir of Angels 
 
Christ has arisen 
Out of corruption’s sea. 
Tear off your bindings 
Joyfully free!         800 Actively praising him, Lovingly claiming him, 
Fraternally aiding him, 
Prayerfully journeying, Joyfully promising,        805 
So is the Master near, 
So is he here! Part I Scene II: In Fr ont Of The City-Gate 
 
(Passers-by of all kinds appear .) 
 
Several Apprentices 
 
So, then, where are you away to? 
 
Others 
 
We’re away to the Hunting Lodge.  
The Former 
 
We’re off to saunter by the Mill.      810 
 
An Apprentice 
 
Off to the Riverside Inn, I’d guess. 
 
A Second Apprentice 
 
The way there’s not of the best. 
 
The Others 
 
What about you? 
 
A Third 
 
I’m with the others, still. 
 
A Fourth  
 
Come to the Castle, you’ll find there 
The prettiest girls, the finest beer,      815 And the best place for a fight.  
A Fifth 
 
You quarrelsome fool, are you looking 
For a third good hiding? 
Not for me, that place, I hate its very sight. 
 
A Maidservant 
 
No, No! I’m going back to town.      820 
 
Another 
 
We’ll find him by those poplar trees for sure. 
 
The First 
 
Well that’s no joy for me , now: 
He’ll walk by your side, of course, 
He’ll dance with you on the green. Where’s the fun in that for me, then!      825 
 
 
The Other 
 
I’m sure he’s not alone, he said 
He’d bring along that Curly-head.  
A Student 
 
My how they strut those bold women! 
Brother, come on! We’ll follow them. 
Fierce tobacco, strong beer,       830 And a girl in her finery, I prefer.  
A Citizen’s Daughter 
 
They are handsome boys there, I see! But it’s truly a disgrace: 
They could have the best of company, 
And run after a painted face!       835  Second Student  (to the first ) 
 
Not so fast! Those two behind, They walk about so sweetly, 
One must be that neighbour of mine: 
I could fall for her completely. They pass by with demure paces,      840 
But in the end they’ll go with us.  
 
The First 
 
Brother, no! I shouldn’t bother, anyway. Quick! Before our quarry gets away. 
The hand that wields a broom on Saturday, 
Gives the best caress, on S unday too, I say.     845 
 
Citizen 
 
No, the new mayor doesn’t suit me! 
Now he’s there he’s getting cocky. 
And what’s he done to help the town? 
Isn’t it getting worse each day? As always it’s us who must obey,      850 
And pay more money down. 
 A Beggar  (sings ) 
 
Fine gentlemen, and lovely ladies, Rosy-cheeked and finely dressed, You could help me, for your aid is 
Needed: see, ease my distress!       855 
Don’t let me throw my song away, Only he who gives is happy. 
A day when all men celebrate, 
Will be a harvest day for me! 
 
Another Citizen 
 
On holidays there’s nothing I like better     860 
Than talking about war and war’s display, When in Turkey far away, 
People one another batter. 
You sit by the window: have a glass: See the bright boats glide down the river,     865 
Then you walk back home and bless 
Its peacefulness, and peace, forever.  
Third Citizen 
 
Neighbour, yes! I like that too: 
Let them go and break their heads, 
Make the mess they often do:       870 So long as we’re safe in our beds. 
 
An Old Woman  (to the citizen’s daughter ) 
 Ah! So pretty! Sweet young blood! 
Who wouldn’t gaze at you? 
Don’t be so proud! I’m very good! And what you want, I’ll bring you.      875 
 
The Citizen’s Daughter 
 
Agatha, come away! I must go carefully:  
No walking freely with such a witch as her: For on Saint Andrew’s Night she really 
Showed me who’ll be my future Lover.   
The Other 
 
She showed me mine in a crystal ball,      880 A soldier, with lots of other brave men: 
I look around: among them all, 
Yet I can never find him.  
The Soldiers 
 
Castles with towering 
Ramparts and wall,        885 
Proud girls showing 
Disdain for us all, We want them to fall! 
The action is brave, 
And splendid the pay!        890 So let the trumpet, 
Do our recruiting, 
Calling to joy Calling to ruin.  
It’s a storm, blowing!        895 
But it’s the life too! Girls and castles We must win you. 
The action is brave, 
Splendid the pay!         900 And the soldiers 
Go marching away. 
 (Faust and Wagner ) 
 
Faust  
 
Rivers and streams are freed from ice 
By Spring’s sweet enlivening glance. Valleys, green with Hope’s happiness, dance:    905 
Old Winter, in his weakness, sighs, 
Withdrawing to the harsh mountains. 
From there, retreating, he sends down  Impotent showers of hail that show 
In stripes across the quickening ground.     910 
But the sun allows nothing white below, 
Change and growth are everywhere, He enlivens all with his colours there, 
And lacking flowers of the fields outspread, 
He takes these gaudy people instead.      915 Turn round, and from this mountain height, Look down, where the town’s in sight. 
That cavernous, dark gate, 
The colourful crowd penetrate, All will take the sun today,       920 
The Risen Lord they’ll celebrate, 
And feel they are resurrected, From low houses, dully made, 
From work, where they’re constricted, 
From the roofs’ and gables’ weight,      925 From the crush of narrow streets, 
From the churches’ solemn night 
They’re all brought to the light. Look now: see! The crowds, their feet 
Crushing the gardens and meadows,      930 
While on the river a cheerful fleet Of little boats, everywhere it flows. And over-laden, ready to sink, 
The last barge takes to the stream. 
From far off on the mountain’s brink, All the bright clothing gleams. 
I hear the noise from the village risen, 
Here is the people’s true Heaven, High and low shout happily: 
Here I am Man: here, da re to be!      940  
Wagner 
 
Doctor, to take a walk with you, Is an honour and a prize: 
Alone I’d have no business here, true, 
Since everything that’s  coarse I despise. 
Shrieking, fiddlers, skittles flying,      945 To me it’s all a hateful noise: 
They rush about possessed, crying,  
And call it singing: and call it joy.  
(Farm-workers under the lime tree. Dance and Song .) 
 The shepherd for the dance, had on 
His gaudy jacket, wreath, and ribbon,      950 
Making a fine show, Under the linden-tree, already, 
Everyone was dancing madly.  
Hey! Hey! Hurrah! Hurray!         955 
So goes the fiddle-bow. 
 In his haste, in a whirl, He stumbled against a girl,  
With his elbow flailing: 
Lively, she turned, and said:       960 Mind out, you wooden-head! 
Hey! Hey! 
Hurrah! Hurray!  Just watch where you’re sailing! 
 
Fast around the circle bright,       965 They danced to left and right, 
Skirts and jackets flying. 
They grew red: they grew warm, They rested, panting, arm on arm Hey! Hey!          970 
Hurrah! Hurray! 
And hip, and elbow, lying.  
Don’t be so familiar then! 
That’s how many a lying man, 
Cheated his wife so!        975 But he soon tempted her aside, 
And from the linden echoed wide: 
Hey! Hey! Hurrah! Hurray! So goes the fiddle-bow.        980 
 
An Old Farmer 
 
Doctor, it’s good of you today 
Not to shun the crowd, So that among the folk, at play, 
The learned man walks about. 
Then have some from the finest jug      985 That we’ve filled with fresh ale first, 
I offer it now and wish it would, 
Not only quench your thirst: But the count of drops it holds 
May it exceed your hours, all told.      990 
 
Faust 
 
I’ll take some of your foaming drink, 
And offer you all, health and thanks.  
(The people gather round him in a circle .) 
 
The Old Farmer 
 
Truly, it’s a thing well done: 
You’re here on our day of happiness, 
Since in evil times now gone, 
You’ve eased our distress! Many a man stands here alive, Whom your father, at the last, 
Snatched from the fever’s rage, 
While the plague went past.       1000 And you, only a young man, went, 
Into every house of sickness, then, 
Though many a corpse wa s carried forth, 
You walked safely out again. Many a hard trial you withstood,      1005 
A Helper helped by the Helper above. 
 
All 
 
Health to the man who’s proven true, 
Long may he help  me and you! 
 
Faust 
 
To Him above bow down instead, 
Who teaches help, and sends his aid.      1010 
 (He walks off, with Wagner .) 
 
Wagner 
 
How it must feel, O man of genius, 
To be respected by the crowd! O happy he whose gifts endow Him with such advantages! 
The father shows you to his son, now      1015 
Each one asks and pushes near, The fiddle halts, and the dancers there: 
You pass: in ranks they stop to see, 
And throw their caps high in the air: A little more and they’d bend the knee,     1020 
As if what they worshipped was holy. 
 
Faust 
 
Climb these few steps to that stone, 
Here we’ll rest from our wandering. Here I’ve sat often, thoughtful and alone, 
Tormenting myself with prayer and fasting.     1025 
Rich in hope, and firm of faith, Wringing my hands, with sighs even, 
Tears, to force the end of plague 
From the very God of Heaven. 
The crowd’s approval now’s like scorn.     1030 O if you could read within me 
How little the father and the son 
Deserve a fraction of their glory. My father was a gloomy, honourable man, Who pondered Nature and the heavenly spheres,    1035 
Honestly, in his own fashion, 
With eccentric studies it appears: He, in his adepts’ company, 
Locked in his dark workshop, forever 
Tried with endless recipes,       1040 To make things opposite flow together. 
The fiery Lion, a daring suitor, 
Wed the Lily, in a lukewarm bath, there In a fiery flame, both of them were 
Strained from one bride-bed into another,     1045 
Until the young Queen was descried, In a mix of colours, in the glass: 
There was the medicine: the patient died. 
And who recovered?  No one asked. 
So we roamed, with our hellish pills,       1050 Among the valleys and the hills, 
Worse than the pestilence itself we were. 
I’ve poisoned a thousand: that’s quite clear: And now from the withered old must hear 
How men praise a shameless murderer.     1055 
 
Wagner 
 
How can you grieve at that! 
Isn’t it enough for an honest man 
To exercise the skill he has, 
Carefully, precisely, as given? Honour your father as a youth,       1060 And receive his teaching in your soul, 
As a man, then, add to  scientific truth, 
So your son can achie ve a higher goal.  Faust 
 
O happy the man who still can hope 
Though drowned in a sea of error!      1065 Man needs the things he doesn’t know, 
What he knows is useless, forever.  
But don’t let such despondency Spoil the deep goodness of the hour! In the evening glow, we see       1070 
The houses gleaming, green-embowered. 
Mild it retreats, the day that’s left, It slips away to claim new being. 
Ah, that no wing from earth can lift 
Me, closer and closer to it, striving!       1075 I’d see, in eternal evening’s light, 
The silent Earth beneath my feet, forever, 
The heights on fire, each valley quiet While silver streams flow to a golden river. 
The wild peaks with their deep clefts,      1080 
Would cease to bar my godlike way, Already the sea with its warm depths, 
Opens to my astonished gaze. 
At last the weary god sinks down to night: But in me a newer yearning wakes,      1085 I hasten on, drinking his endless light: 
The dark behind me: and ahead the day. 
Heaven above me: a nd the waves below, 
A lovely dream, although it vanishes. 
Ah! Wings of the mind, so weightless       1090 
No bodily wings could ever be so. Yet it’s natural in every spirit, too, 
That feeling drives us, up and on, 
When over us, lost in the vault of blue, The lark sings his piercing song,      1095 
When over the steep pine-filled peaks, 
The eagle widely soars, And across the plains and seas, The cranes seek their home shores.  
Wagner 
 
I’ve often had strange mo ments, I know,     1100 
But I’ve never felt yearnings quite like those: 
The joys of woods and fields soon fade 
I wouldn’t ask the birds for wings: indeed, How differently the mind’s raptures lead Us on, from book to book, and page to page!     1105 
Then winter nights are beautiful, and sweet, 
A blissful warmth steals through your limbs, too When you’ve unrolled some noble text, complete, 
Oh, how heaven’s light descends on you! 
 
Faust 
 
You only feel the one yearning at best,     1110 
Oh, never seek to know the other! 
Two souls, alas, exist in my breast, 
One separated from another: One, with its crude love of life, just 
Clings to the world, tenaciously, grips tight,     1115 
The other soars powerfully above the dust, Into the far ancestral height. Oh, let the spirits of the air, 
Between the heavens and Earth, weaving, 
Descend through the golden atmosphere,     1120 And lead me on to ne w and varied being! 
Yes, if a magic cloa k were mine, that 
Would carry me off to foreign lands, Not for the costliest garment in my hands, 
For the mantle of a king, would I resign it!     1125 
 
Wagner 
 
Don’t call to that familiar crowd, 
Streaming in misty circles, spreading, Preparing a thousand dangers now, 
On every side, for human beings. 
The North winds’ sharp teeth penetrate,     1130 Down here, and spit you with their fangs: 
Then the East’s drying winds are at the gate, 
To feed themselves on your lungs. 
If, from the South, the desert sends them, And fire on fire burns on your brow,      1135 
The West brings a swarm to quench them, 
And you and field and meadow drown. They hear us, while they’re harming us, Hear us, while they are betraying: 
They make out they’re from heaven above,     1140 
And lisp like angels when they’re lying. Let’s go on! The world has darkened, 
The air is cool: the mists descend! 
Man values his own house at night.  What is it occupies your sight?       1145 
What troubles you so, in the evening? 
 
Faust 
 
Through corn and stubble, see that black dog running? 
 
Wagner 
 
I saw him long ago: he se ems a wretched thing. 
 
Faust 
 
Look at him closely! What do you make of him? 
 
Wagner 
 
A dog that, in the way they do,       1150 
Sniffs around to find his master.  
Faust 
 
See how he winds in wide spirals too, Round us here, yet always coming nearer? 
And if I’m right, I see a swirl of fire 
Twisting about, behind his track.      1155  
Wagner 
 
Perhaps your eyesight proves a liar, I only see a dog, that’s black. 
 
Faust 
 
It seems to me that with a subtle magic, 
He winds a fatal knot around our feet. 
 
Wagner 
 
I see his timid and uncertain antics,      1160 
It’s strangers, not his ma ster, whom he meets.  
 
Faust 
 
The circle narrows: now he’s here! 
 
Wagner 
 
You see a dog, there’s no spectre near!    
He barks uncertainly, lies down and crawls, Wags his tail. Dogs’ habits , after all.      1165 
 
Faust 
 
Come on! Here, now! Here, to me! 
 
Wagner 
 
He’s a dogged hound, I agree. 
Stand still and he holds his ground: 
Talk to him, he dances round: 
What you’ve lost, he’ll bring to you:      1170 Retrieve a stick from the water, too.  
Faust 
 You’re right: and I see nothing 
Like a Spirit there, it’s only training. 
 
Wagner 
 
A wise man finds agreeable, 
A dog that’s learnt its lesson well.      1175 Yes, he deserves all your favour, Among the students, the true scholar! 
 
(They enter the City gate .) Part I Scene III: The Study 
 
(Faust enters, with the dog .) 
 
Faust 
 
Fields and meadows now I’ve left 
Clothed in deepest night, Full of presentiments, a holy dread      1180 
Wakes the better soul in me to light. 
Wild desires no longer stir At every restless act of mine: 
Love for Humanity is here, 
And here is Love Divine.        1185  
Quiet, dog! Stop running to and fro! 
Why are you snuffling at the door? Lie down now, behind the stove,  
There’s my best cushion on the floor. 
Since you amused us running, leaping,     1190 Out on the mountainside, with zest, 
Now I take you into my keeping, 
A welcome, and a silent guest.  Ah, when in our narrow room, 
The friendly lamp glows on the shelf,      1195 
Brightness burns in our inner gloom, In the Heart, that knows itself. 
Reason speaks with insistence, 
And Hope once more appears, We see the River of Existence,       1200 
Ah, the founts of Life, are near.  
Don’t growl, dog! With this holy sound 
Which I, with all my soul, embrace, 
Your bestial noise seems out of place. Men usually scorn the things, I’ve found,     1205 
That, by them, can’t be understood,  
Grumbling at beauty, and the good, That to them seems wearisome: Can’t a dog, then, snarl like them? 
 
Oh, yet now I can feel no contentment      1210 Flow through me, despite  my best intent. 
Why must the stream fail so quickly, 
And once again leave us thirsty? I’ve long experience of it, yet I think 
I could supply what’s missing, easily:     1215 
We learn to value what’s beyond the earthly, We yearn to reach revelation’s brink, 
That’s nowhere nobler or more excellent 
Than where it burns in  the New Testament. 
I yearn to render the first version,      1220 
With true feeling, once and for all, 
Translate the sacred original Into my beloved German.  
(He opens the volume, and begins .) 
 
It’s written here: ‘In the Beginning was the Word!’ Here I stick already! Who can help me? It’s absurd,   1225 
Impossible, for me to rate the word so highly 
I must try to say it differently If I’m truly inspired by the Spirit. I find I’ve written here: ‘In the Beginning was the Mind’. 
Let me consider that first sentence,      1230 
So my pen won’t run on in advance! Is it Mind that works and creates what’s ours?  
It should say: ‘In the beginning was the Power!’ 
Yet even while I write the words down, I’m warned: I’m no closer with these I’ve found.    1235 
The Spirit helps me! I have it now, intact. 
And firmly write: ‘In the Beginning was the Act!’ 
 
If I’m to share my room with you, 
Dog, you can stop howling too: Stop your yapping!        1240 
A fellow who’s always snapping, 
I can’t allow too near me. One of us you see, Must leave the other free. 
I’ve no more hospitality to show,      1245 
The door’s open, you can go. But what’s this I see! 
Can this happen naturally? 
Is it a phantom or is it real? The dog’s growing big and tall.       1250 
He rises powerfully, 
It’s no doglike shape I see!  What a spectre I brought home! 
Like a hippo in the room, 
With fiery eyes, and fearful jaws.      1255 Oh! Now, what you are, I’m sure! The Key of Solomon is good 
For conjuring your half-hellish brood. 
 Spirits  (In the corridor .) 
 
Something’s trapped inside! 
Don’t follow it: stay outside!       1260 Like a fox in a snare 
An old lynx from hell trembles there. 
Be careful what you’re about! Float here: float there, Under and over,         1265 
And he’ll work his way out. 
If you know how to help him, Don’t let yourself fail him! 
Since it’s all done for sure, 
Just for your pleasure.        1270  
Faust 
 
First speak the Words of the Four 
To encounter the creature. 
Salamander, be glowing, Undine, flow near, 
Sylph, disappear,         1275 
Gnome, be delving.  Who does not know 
The Elements so, 
Their power sees, And properties,         1280 
Cannot lord it 
Over the Spirits.  
Vanish in flame, 
Salamander! Rush together in foam,        1285 
Undine! 
Shine with meteor-gleam, Sylph! Bring help to the home, 
Incubus! Incubus!         1290 
Go before and end it thus!  
None of the Four 
Show in the creature. 
He lies there quietly grinning at me: I’ve not stirred him enough it seems.      1295 
But you’ll hear how 
I’ll press him hard now. My good fellow, are you Exiled from Hell’s crew? 
Witness the Symbol        1300 
Before which they bow, The dark crowd there! 
Now it swells, with its bristling hair. 
Depraved being! Can you know what you’re seeing?      1305 
The uncreated One 
With name unexpressed, Poured through Heaven,  
Pierced without redress? 
 Spellbound, behind the stove,       1310 
An elephant grows. 
It fills the room, completely,  It will vanish like mist, I can see. Don’t rise to the ceiling! 
Lie down at your master’s feet!       1315 
You see I don’t threaten you lightly. I’ll sting you with fire that’s holy! 
Don’t wait for the bright 
Triple glowing Light! Don’t wait for         1320 
My highest art! 
 (As the mist clears, Mephistopheles step s from behind the stove, dressed as a 
wandering Scholar .) 
 
Mephistopheles  
Why such alarms? What command would my lord impart? 
 Faust 
 
This was the dog’s core! 
A wandering scholar? The fact makes me smile. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I bow to the learned lord!        1325 You certainly made me  sweat, in style. 
 
Faust 
 
How are you named? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
         A slight question 
For one who so disdains the Word, 
Is so distant from appearance: one 
Whom only the vital depths have stirred.      1330 
 
Faust 
 
We usually gather from your names The nature of you gentlemen: it’s plain 
What you are, we all too clearly recognise 
One who’s called Liar, Ruin , Lord of the Flies. 
Well, what are you then?        1335 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
          Part of the Power that would 
Always wish Evil, and always works the Good. 
 
Faust  
 
What meaning to these riddling words applies?   
Mephistopheles 
 
I am the spirit, ever, that denies! 
And rightly so: since everything created, 
In turn deserves to be annihilated:      1340 
Better if nothing came to be. So all that you call Sin, you see, Destruction, in short, what you’ve meant 
By Evil is my true element. 
 
Faust 
 
You call yourself a part, ye t seem complete to me? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I’m speaking the truth to you, and modestly. 
Even if Man’s accustomed to take 
His small world for the Whole, that’s his mistake: I’m part of the part, th at once was - everything, 
Part of the darkness, from which Light, issuing,    1350 
Proud Light, emergent, disputed the highest place With its mother Night, the bounds of Space, And yet won nothing, how ever hard it tried, 
Still stuck to Bodily Things, and so denied. 
It flows from bodies, which it beautifies,     1355 And bodies block its way: 
I hope the day’s not far away 
When it, along with all these bodies, dies.  
Faust 
 
Now I see the plan you follow! 
You can’t destroy it all, and so       1360 
You’re working on a smaller scale.  
Mephistopheles 
 
And frankly it’s a sorry tale. What’s set against the Nothingness, 
The Something, World’s clumsiness, 
Despite everything I’ve tried,       1365 
Won’t become a nothing: though I’d Storms, quakes, and fires on every hand, 
It deigned to stay as sea and land! 
And those Men and creatures, all the damned, It’s no use my owning any of that crew:     1370 How many I’ve already done with too! 
Yet new fresh blood is always going round. 
So it goes on, men make me furious! 
With water, earth and air, of course, 
A thousand buds unfurl        1375 
In wet and dry, warm and cold! And if I hadn’t kept back fire of old, 
I’d have nothing left at all. 
 
Faust 
 
So you set the Devil’s fist 
That vainly clenches itself,       1380 
Against the eternally active, 
Wholesome, creative force! Strange son of Chaos, start On something else instead! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Truly I’ll think about it: more       1385 
Next time, on that head! Might I be allowed to go? 
 
Faust 
 
I see no reason for you to ask it. 
Since I’ve learnt to know you now, When you wish: then make a visit.      1390 There’s the door, here’s the window, 
And, of course, there’s the chimney. 
 Mephistopheles 
 
I must confess, I’m prevented though 
By a little thing that hinders me, The Druid’s-foot on your doorsill –      1395 
 
Faust  
 
The Pentagram gives you pain? 
Then tell me, you Son of Hell, 
If that’s the case, how did you gain Entry? Are spirits like you cheated? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Look carefully! It’s not completed:      1400 
One angle, if you inspect it closely Has, as you see, been left a little open. 
 
Faust 
 
Just by chance as it happens! 
And left you prisoner to me? Success created by approximation!      1405  
Mephistopheles 
 
The dog saw nothing, in his animation, 
Now the affair seems inside out, 
The Devil can’t get out of the house. 
 
Faust 
 
Why not try the window then? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
To devils and ghosts the same  laws appertain:    1410 
The same way they ente r in, they must go out. 
In the first we’re free, in the second slaves to the act.  
Faust 
 
So you still have laws in Hell, in fact? That’s good, since it allows a pact,  
And one with you gentlemen truly binds?      1415 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
What’s promised you’ll enjoy, and find, 
There’s nothing mean that we enact. But it can’t be done so fast,  
First we’ll have to talk it through,  
Yet, urgently, I beg of you        1420  Let me go my way at last. 
 
Faust 
 
Wait a moment now, 
Tell me some good news first.  
Mephistopheles 
 
I’ll soon be back, just let me go: 
Then you can ask me what you wish.      1425 
 
Faust 
 
I didn’t place you here, tonight. 
You trapped yourself in the lime. Who snares the devil, holds him tight! 
He won’t be caught like that a second time. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I’m willing, if you so wish,       1430 
To stay here, in your company: So long as we pass the time, and I insist, 
On arts of mine, exclusively. 
 Faust 
 
Gladly, you’re free to present 
Them, as long as they’re all pleasant.      1435  
Mephistopheles 
 
My friend you’ll win more 
For your senses, in an hour, 
Than in a whole year’s monotony. 
What the tender spirits sing, The lovely pictures that they bring,      1440 
Are no empty wizardry. 
First your sense of smell’s invited, Then your palate is delighted, 
And then your touch, you see. 
Now, I need no preparation,       1445 We’re all here, so  let’s begin! 
 
Spirits 
 
Vanish, you shadowy 
Vaults above! Cheerfully show, The friendliest blue        1450 
Of aether, down here. 
Would that shadowy Clouds had gone! 
Starlight sparkling 
Milder sun          1455 Shining clear.  
Heavenly children 
In lovely confusion, Swaying and bending, 
Drifting past.         1460 
Affectionate yearning, Following fast: Their garments flowing 
With fluttering ribbons, 
Cover the gardens,         1465 Cover the leaves, 
Where with each other 
In deep conversation 
Lover meets lover. Leaves on leaves!         1470 
Tendrils’ elation! 
Grapes beneath Crushed in a stream, Pressed to extreme, 
Crushed to fountain,        1475 
Of foaming wine, Trickling, fine, 
Through rocks divine, 
Leaving the heights, Spreading beneath,         1480 
Broad as the seas, 
Valleys it fills Round the green hills. 
And the wings still, 
Blissfully drunk,         1485 F l y  t o  t h e  s u n ,           
Fly to the brightness, 
Towards the islands, Out of the waves Magically raised:         1490 
Now we can hear 
The choir of joy near, Over the meadow, 
See how they dance now,   
All in the air          1495 Dispersing there.     
Some of them climbing 
Over the mountains, Others are swimming 
Over the ocean,         1500 
Others take flight: All towards Life, All towards distant, 
Love of the stars, and 
Approval’s bliss.         1505  
Mephistopheles 
 
He’s asleep! Enough, you delicate children of air! 
You’ve sung to him faithfully, I declare! 
I’m in your debt for all this. 
He’s not yet the man to hold devils fast! Spellbind him with dream-forms, cast      1510 Him deep into illusions’ sea: 
Now, for the magic sill I must pass, 
I could use rat’s teeth: no need for me To conjure up a lengthier spell, 
One’s rustling here that will do well.       1515 
 The Lord of Rats and Mice, 
Of Flies, Frogs, Bugs and Lice, 
Summons you to venture here, And gnaw the threshold where 
He stains it with a little oil -       1520 
You’ve hopped, already, to your toil! Now set to work! The fatal point,  
Is at the edge, it’s on the front.  
One more bite, then it’s complete – Now Faust, dream deeply, till we meet.     1525  
Faust  (Waking .)  
 Am I cheated then, once again? 
Does the Spirit-Realm’s deep yearning fade: 
So a mere dream has c onjured up the devil, 
And only a dog, it was, that ran away? Part I Scene IV: The Study 
 
(Faust, Mephistopheles ) 
 
Faust   
 
A knock? Enter! Who’s plagui ng me again?     1530 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I am 
 
Faust 
 
Enter!  
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Three times you must say it, then. 
 
Faust  
 
So! Enter!  
 
Mephistopheles 
 
 Ah, now, you please me. 
I hope we’ll get along together: 
To drive away the gloomy weather, 
I’m dressed like young nobility,       1535 In a scarlet gold-trimmed coat, 
In a little silk-lined cloak, 
A cockerel feather in my hat, With a long, pointed sword, 
And I advise you, at that,        1540 
To do as I do, in a word: So that, footloose, fancy free, You can experience Life, with me. 
 Faust 
 
This life of earth, its narrowness, 
Pains me, however I’m turned out,      1545 I’m too old to play about, 
Too young, still, to be passionless. 
What can the world bring me again? Abstain! You shall! You must! Abstain! That’s the eternal song        1550 
That in our ears, forever, rings  
The one, that, our whole life long, Every hour, hoarsely, sings. 
I wake in terror with the dawn, 
I cry, the bitterest tears, to see       1555 Day grant no wish of mine, not one 
As it passes by on its journey. 
Even presentiments of joy Ebb, in wilful depreciation: 
A thousand grimaces life employs      1560 
To hinder me in creation. Then when night descends I must 
Stretch out, worried, on my bed: 
What comes to me is never rest, But some wild dream instead.        1565 The God that lives inside my heart, 
Can rouse my innermost seeing: 
The one enthroned beyond my art, Can’t stir external being: 
And so existence is a burden: sated,      1570 
Death’s desired, and Life is hated.   
Mephistopheles 
 
Yet Death’s a guest who’s visi t’s never wholly celebrated. 
 
Faust 
 
Happy the man whom victory enhances, 
Whose brow the bloodstained laurel warms, 
Who, after the swift whirling dances,      1575 Finds himself in some girl’s arms! 
If only, in my joy, then, I’d sunk down 
Before that enrapturing Spirit power! 
 
Mephistopheles  
 
Yet someone, from a certain brown 
Liquid, drank not a drop, at  midnight hour.     1580 
 
Faust 
 
It seems that you delight in spying. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I know a lot: and yet I’m not all-knowing.  
 
Faust 
 
When sweet familiar tones drew me, 
Away from the tormenting crowd, 
Then my other childhood feelings       1585 
Better times echoed,  and allowed. 
So I curse whatever snares the soul, In its magical, enticing arms, 
Banishes it to this mournful hole, 
With dazzling, seductive charms!      1590 Cursed be those high Opinions first, 
With which the mind entraps itself! 
Then glittering Appearance curse, In which the senses lose themselves! 
Curse what deceives us in our dreaming,     1595 
With thoughts of everlasting fame! Curse the flattery of ‘possessing’ 
Wife and child, lands and name! 
Curse Mammon, when he drives us To bold acts to win our treasure:      1600 Or straightens out our pillows 
For us to idle at our leisure! 
Curse the sweet jui ce of the grape! Curse the highest favour s Love lets fall! 
Cursed be Hope! Cursed be Faith,      1605 
And cursed be Patience most of all! 
 Choir of Spirits  (Unseen ) 
 
Sorrow! Sorrow! You’ve destroyed it, The beautiful world, 
With a powerful fist:        1610 
It tumbles, it’s hurled To ruin! A demigod crushed it! 
We carry 
Fragments into the void, And sadly          1615 
Lament the Beauty that’s gone. 
Stronger For all of Earth’s sons, 
Brighter, 
Build it again,         1620 Build, in your heart! 
Life’s new start, 
Begin again, With senses washed clean, And sound, then,         1625 
A newer art! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
They’re little, but fine, 
These attendants of mine. 
Precocious advice they give, listen, 
Regarding both action, and passion!      1630 Into the World outside, 
From Solitude, that’s dried 
Your sap and senses, They tempt us.  Stop playing with grief,        1635 
That feeds, a vulture, on your breast, 
The worst society, you’ll find, will prompt belief,  That you’re a Man among the rest. 
Not that I mean 
To shove you into the mass.       1640 
Among ‘the greats’, I’m second-class: But if you, in my company, 
Your path through life would wend, 
I’ll willingly condescend To serve you, as we go.        1645 I’m your man, and so, 
If it suits you of course, 
I’m your slave: I’m yours!  
Faust 
 
And what must I do in exchange? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
There’s lots of time: you’ve got the gist.     1650 
 
Faust 
 
No, no! The Devil is an egotist, 
Does nothing lightly, or in God’s name, To help another, so I insist, 
Speak your demands out loud, 
Such servants are risks, in a house.      1655  
Mephistopheles 
 
I’ll be your servant here, and I’ll 
Not stop or rest, at your decree: 
When we’re together, on the other side,  You’ll do the same for me.  
Faust 
 
The ‘other side’ concerns me less:      1660 
Shatter this world, in pieces,  
The other one can take its place, 
The root of my joy’s on this Earth, And this Sun lights my sorrow: If I must part from them tomorrow,      1665 
What can or will be, that I’ll face. 
I’ll hear no more of it, of whether In that future, men both hate and love, 
Or whether in those spheres, forever,  
We’re given a below and an above.      1670 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
In that case, you can venture all. 
Commit yourself: today, you shall 
View my arts with joy: I mean To show you what no man has seen. 
 
Faust 
 
Poor devil what can you give? When has ever    1675 
A human spirit, in its highest endeavour, 
Been understood by such a one as you? You have a never-satiating food, 
You have your restless gold, a slew 
Of quicksilver, melting in the hand,      1680 Games whose prize no man can land, 
A girl, who while she’s on my arm, 
Snares a neighbour, with her eyes: And Honour’s fine and godlike charm, 
That, like a meteor, dies?        1685 
Show me fruits then that rot, before they’re ready. And trees grown green again, each day, too!  
Mephistopheles 
 
Such commands don’t frighten me: 
With such treasures I can truly serve you. 
Still, my good friend, a time may come,     1690 
When one prefers to eat  what’s good in peace. 
 
Faust 
 
When I lie quiet in bed, at ease. 
Then let my time be done! 
If you fool me, with flatteries, 
Till my own self’s a joy to me,       1695 If you snare me with luxury – 
Let that be the last day I see! 
That bet I’ll make!  
Mephistopheles 
Done! 
 
Faust 
     And quickly! 
When, to the Moment then, I say: ‘Ah, stay a while! You are so lovely!’      1700 
Then you can grasp me: then you may, 
Then, to my ruin, I’ll go gladly! Then they can ring the passing bell, 
Then from your service you are free, 
The clocks may halt, the hands be still,     1705 
And time be past and done, for me! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Consider well, we’ll not forget.  
Faust 
 
You have your rights, complete: 
I never over-estimate my powers. 
I’ll be a slave, in defeat:        1710 
Why ask whose slave or yours?  
Mephistopheles 
 
Today, likewise, at the Doctors’ Feast 
I’ll do my duty as your servant. 
One thing, though! – Re: life and death, I want 
A few lines from you, at the least.      1715  
 
Faust 
 
You pedant, you demand it now in writing? 
You still won’t take Man’ s word for anything? 
It’s not enough that the things I say, 
Will always accord with my future? 
The world never ceases to wear away,      1720 And shall a promise bind me, then, forever? Yet that’s the illusion in our minds, 
And who then would be free of it? 
Happy the man, who pure truth finds,  And who’ll never deign to sacrifice it!      1725 
Still a document, written and signed, 
That’s a ghost makes all men fear it. The word is already dying in the pen, 
And wax and leather hold the power then. 
What do you want from me base spirit?     1730 Will iron: marble: pa rchment: paper do it? 
Shall I write with stylus, pen or chisel? 
I’ll leave the whole decision up to you.  
Mephistopheles 
 
Why launch into oratory too? Hot-tempered: you exaggerate as well.     1735 
Any bit of paper’s just as good. 
And you can sign it with a drop of blood.  
Faust 
 
If it will satisfy you, and it should, 
Then let’s complete the farce in full. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Blood is a quite special fluid.       1740 
 
Faust 
 
Have no fear I’ll break this pact! 
The extreme I can promise you: it is 
All the power my efforts can extract. 
I’ve puffed myself up so highly  I belong in your ranks now.       1745 The mighty Spirit scorns me  
And Nature shuts me out. 
The thread of thought has turned to dust, Knowledge fills me with disgust. 
Let the depths of sensuality       1750 
Satisfy my burning passion! And, its impenetrable mask on, 
Let every marvel be  prepared for me! 
Let’s plunge into time’s torrent, Into the whirlpools of event!       1755 
Then let joy, and distress, 
Frustration, and success, Follow each other, as well they can: Restless activity proves the man!  
Mephistopheles 
 
No goal or measure’s set for you.      1760 Do as you wish, nibble at everything, 
Catch at fragments while you’re flying, 
Enjoy it all, whatever you find to do. Now grab at it, and don’t be stupid!  
Faust 
 
It’s not joy we’re about: you heard it.      1765 
I’ll take the frenzy, pain-filled elation, 
Loving hatred, enlivening frustration. Cured of its urge to know, my mind 
In future, will not hide from any pain, 
And what is shared by all mankind,      1770 In my innermost self, I’ll contain: 
My soul will grasp the high and low, 
My heart accumulate its bliss and woe, 
So this self will embrace all theirs, 
That, in the end, their fate it shares.      1775 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Believe me, many a thousand year 
They’ve chewed hard food, and yet From the cradle to the bier, 
Not one has ever digested it! 
Trust one of us, this Whole thing      1780 Was only made for a god’s delight! 
In eternal splendour he is dwelling, 
He placed us in the darkness quite, And only gave you day and night. 
 
Faust 
 
But, I will!          1785 
 Mephistopheles 
 
  That’s good to hear! 
Yet I’ve a fear, just the one: Time is short, and art is long. 
I think you need instruction. 
Join forces with a poet: use poetry, Let him roam in imagination,       1790 
You’ll gain every noble quality 
From your honorary  occupation, 
The lion’s brave attitude The wild stag’s swiftness, 
The Italian’s fiery blood,        1795 
The North’s persistence. Let him find the mysterious 
Meeting of generous and devious, 
While you, with passions young and hot, 
Fall in love, according to the plot.      1800 
I’d like to see such a gentleman, among us, 
And I’d call him Mister Microcosmus.  
Faust 
 
What am I then, if it’s a flight too far, 
For me to gain that human crown 
I yearn towards with every sense I own?     1805 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
In the end, you are – what you are. 
Set your hair in a thousand curlicues 
Place your feet in yard-high shoes, 
You’ll remain forever, what you are.  
Faust 
 
All the treasures of the human spirit      1810 
I feel that I’ve expended, uselessly. 
And wherever, at the last, I sit, 
No new power flows, in me. I’m not a hair’s breadth taller, as you see, 
And I’m no nearer to Infinity.        1815 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
My dear sir, you see the thing 
Exactly as all men see it: why, We must re-order everything, Before the joys of life slip by. 
Hang it! Hands and feet, belong to you,     1820 
Certainly, a head, and a backside, Yet everything I use as new 
Why is my ownership of it denied? 
When I can count on six stallions, Isn’t their horsepower mine to use?      1825 
I drive behind, and am a proper man, 
As though I’d twenty-four legs, too. Look lively! Leave the senses be, 
And plunge into the world with me! 
I say to you that scholarly fellows      1830 Are like the cattle on an arid heath: 
Some evil spirit leads them round in circles, 
While sweet green meadows lie beneath.  
Faust 
 
How shall we begin then? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
  From here, we’ll first win free. 
What kind of a martyrs’ hole can this be?     1835 
What kind of a teacher of life is he, Who fills young minds with ennui?  
Let your neighbours do it, and go! 
Do you want to thresh straw forever? The best things you can ever know,      1840 You dare not tell the youngsters, ever. 
I hear one of them arriving, too! 
 Faust 
 
I’ve no desire to see him, though. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
The poor lad’s waited hours for you. 
He mustn’t go away un-consoled.      1845 Come: give me your cap and gown. 
The mask should look delicious. So! 
 (He disguises himself .) 
 
Now I’ve lost what wit’s my own! I want fifteen minutes with him, only:  
Meanwhile get ready for our journey!      1850 
 (Faust exits .) 
 
Mephistopheles  (In Faust’s long gown .) 
 
Reason and Scienc e you despise, 
Man’s highest powers: now the lies Of the deceiving spirit must bind you With those magic arts that blind you, 
And I’ll have you, totally –       1855 
Fate gave him such a spirit It urges him ever onwards, wildly, 
And, in his hasty striving, he has leapt  
Beyond all earth’s ecstasies. I’ll drag him through raw life,       1860 
Through the meaningless and shallow, 
I’ll freeze him: stick to him: keep him ripe, 
Frustrate his insatiable greed, allow 
Food and drink to drift before his eyes: 
In vain he’ll beg for consummation,      1865 And if he weren’t the devil’s, why 
He’d still go to his ruination! 
 
(A student enters. )  
Student 
 
I’m only here momentarily, 
I’ve come, filled with humility, 
To speak to, and to stand before ,      1870 
One who’s spoken of with awe. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Your courtesy delights me greatly! 
A man like other men you see. 
Have you studied then, elsewhere? 
 
Student 
 
I beg you, please enrol me, here!      1875 I come to you strong of courage, 
Lined in pocket, healthy for my age: 
My mother didn’t want to lose me: though, I’d like to learn what it’ s right for me to know. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Then you’ve come to the right place, exactly.    1880 
 
Student 
 
To be honest, I’d like to go already: 
There’s little pleasure for me at all, In these walls, and all these halls. 
It’s such a narrow space I find, 
You see no trees, no leaves of any kind,     1885 And in the lectures, on the benches, 
All thought deserts me , and my senses.  
Mephistopheles 
 
It will only come to you with habit. 
So the child takes its mother’s breast 
Quite unwillingly at first, and yet it      1890 
Soon sucks away at her with zest. So will you at Wisdom’s breast, here, Feel every day a little zestier. 
 
Student 
 
I’ll cling to her neck with pleasure: 
But only tell me how to find her.      1895  
Mephistopheles 
 
Explain, before you travel on 
What faculty you’ve settled on. 
 
Student 
 
I want to be a true scholar, 
I want to grasp, by the collar, What’s on earth, in heaven above,      1900 
In Science, and in Nature too. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Then here’s the very path for you, 
But don’t allow yourself to wander off. 
 
Student 
 
I’ll be present heart and soul: 
Of course I’ll want to play,       1905 Have some fun and freedom, though, On each sweet summer holiday.  
Mephistopheles 
 
Use your time well: it slips away so fast, yet Discipline will teach you how to win it.  
My dear friend, I’d advise, in sum,      1910 
First, the Collegium Logicum. 
There your mind will be trained, As if in Spanish boots, constrained, 
So that painfully, as it ought,  
It creeps along the way of thought,      1915 Not flitting about all over, 
Wandering here and there. 
So you’ll learn, in many days, What you used to do, untaught, as in a haze, 
Like eating now, and drinking, you’ll see     1920 
The necessity  of One! Two! Three!  
Truly the intricacy of logic  
Is like a master-weaver’s fabric, 
Where the loom holds a thousand threads, Here and there the shuttles go        1925 
And the threads, invisibly, flow, 
One pass serves for a thousand instead. Then the philosopher steps in: he’ll show That it certainly had to be so: 
The first was - so, the second - so,      1930 
And so, the third and fourth were - so: If first and second had never been, 
Third and fourth would not be seen. 
All praise the schol ars, beyond believing, 
But few of them  ever turn to weaving.      1935 
To know and note the living, you’ll find it 
Best to first dispense with the spirit: Then with the pieces in your hand, 
Ah! You’ve only lost the spiritual bond. 
 ‘Natural treatment’, Chemistry calls it     1940 Mocks at herself, and doesn’t know it.  
Student 
 
I’m not sure that I quite understand.  
Mephistopheles 
 
You’ll soon know it all, as planned, When you’ve learnt the science of reduction, 
And everything’s proper classification.     1945 
 
Student 
 
After all that, I feel as stupid 
As if I’d a mill wheel in my head. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Next, before all else, you’ll fix 
Your mind on Metaphysics! See that you’re profoundly trained      1950 
In what never  stirs in a human brain: 
You’ll learn a splendid word For what’s occurred or not occurred. But for the present take six months 
To get yourself in order: start at once.      1955 
Five hours every day, lock Yourself in, with a ticking clock! 
Make sure you’re well prepared, 
Study each paragraph with care, So afterwards you’ll be certain       1960 
Only what’s in the book, was written: 
Then be as diligent when you pen it, As if the Holy Ghost had said it!  
Student 
 
You won’t need to tell me twice! 
I think, myself, it’s very helpful, too      1965 
That one can take back home, and use, 
What someone’s penned in black and white.  
Mephistopheles 
 
But choose a faculty, any one!  
Student 
 
I wouldn’t be comfortable with Law. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I couldn’t name you anything more      1970 
Vile, I know how dogmatic it’s become. Laws and rights are handed down 
It’s an eternal disgrace: 
They’re moved round from town to town Dragged around from place to place.      1975 Reason is nonsense, kindness a disease, 
If you’re a grandchild it’s a curse! 
The rights we are born with, To those, alas, no one refers! 
 
Student 
 
That just strengthens my disgust.      1980 
Happy the student that you instruct! I’ve nearly settled on Theology.  
Mephistopheles 
 
I wouldn’t wish to guide you erroneously. 
In what that branch of knowledge concerns 
It’s so difficult to avoid a fallacious route,     1985 
There’s so much poison hidd en in what you learn, 
And it’s barely distinguishable from the antidote. The best thing here’s to  make a single choice, 
Then simply swear by your master’s voice . 
On the whole, to words stick fast!      1990 Through the safest gate you’ll pass 
To the Temple of Certainty. 
 
Student 
 
Yet surely words must have a sense.  
Mephistopheles 
 
Why, yes! But don’t torment yourself with worry, 
Where sense fails it’s only necessary      1995 
To supply a word, and change the tense. With words fine arguments can be weighted, With words whole Systems can be created, 
With words, the mind does its conceiving, 
No word suffers a jot from thieving.      2000  
Student 
 
Forgive me, I delay you with my questions, 
But I must trouble you again, 
On the subject of Medicine, Have you no helpful word to say?  
Three years, so little time applied,      2005 
And, God, the field is rather wide! If only you had some kind of pointer, You would feel so much further on.  
Mephistopheles (Aside .) 
 
I’m tired of this desiccated banter  I really must play the devil, at once.      2010 
 
(Aloud .) 
 To grasp the spirit of Medicine’s easily done: 
You study the great a nd little world, until, 
In the end you let it carry on Just as God wills. 
Useless to roam round, scientifically:      2015 
Everyone learns only what he can: The one who grasps the Moment fully, 
He’s the proper man. 
You’re quite a well-made fellow, You’re not short of courage too,      2020 
And when you’re easy with yourself, 
Others will be easy with you. Study, especially, female behaviour:  
Their eternal aches and woes, 
All of the thousand-fold,        2025 Rise from one point, and have one cure. And if you’re half honourable about it 
You shall have them in your pocket. 
A title first: to give them comfort you Have skills that far exceed the others,      2030 
Then you’re free to touch the goods, and view 
What someone else has prowled around for years. 
Take the pulse firmly, you understand, 
And then, with sidelong fiery glance, 
Grasp the slender hips, in haste,       2035 To find out whether she’s tight-laced. 
 
Student 
 
That sounds much better! Th e Where and How, I see.  
Mephistopheles 
 
Grey, dear friend, is all theory, 
And green the golden tree of life. 
 
Student 
 
I swear it’s like a dream to me: may I      2040 
Trouble you, at some further time,  
To expound your wisdom, so sublime?  
Mephistopheles 
 
As much as I can, I’ll gladly explain. 
 
Student 
 
I can’t tear myself away, 
I must just pass you my album, sir,      2045 Grant me the favour of your signature! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Very well. 
 
(He writes and gives the book back .) 
 
Student (Reading Mephistopheles’ Latin in scription which means: ‘You’ll 
be like God, acquainted with good and evil’. ) 
 
Eritis sicut Deus, scientes bonum et malum. 
 (He makes his bows, and takes his leave. ) 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Just follow the ancient text, a nd my mother the snake, too: 
And then your likeness to God will surely frighten you!   2050 
  
(Faust enters .) 
 
Faust 
 
Where will we go, then? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
      Where you please. 
The little world, and then  the great, we’ll see. 
With what profit and delight, 
This term, you’ll be a parasite! 
 
Faust 
 
Yet with my long beard, I’ll       2055 
Lack life’s superficial style. 
My attempt will come to nothing: 
I know, in this world, I don’t fit in. I feel so small next to other men, 
It only means embarrassment.       2060 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
My friend, just give yourself completely to it: 
When you find yourself, you’ll soon know how to live it. 
 
Faust 
 
How shall we depart from here, then? 
I see not one servant, coach, or horse. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
We’ll just spread this cloak wide open,     2065 
Then through the air we’ll take our course. For a daring trip like this we’re on, 
Better not take mu ch baggage along. 
A little hot air I’ll ready, first, To lift us nimbly above the Earth,      2070 
And as we’re light we’ll soon get clear: 
Congratulations on your new career!  
Part I Scene V: Auerbach’s Cellar in Leipzig 
 
(Friends happily drinking. ) 
 
Frosch 
 
Will none of you laugh? Nobody drink? I’ll have to teach  you to smile, I think! 
You’re all of you like we t straw today,     2075 
And usually you’re well away.  
Brander 
 
That’s up to you, you bring us nothing. 
Nothing dumb, or dirty, nothing. 
 Frosch (Pouring a glass of wine over Brander’s head .) 
 
You can have both!  
Brander 
    Rotten swine! 
 
Frosch 
 
You wanted them both, so you got mine!     2080 
 
Siebel 
 
Out the door, whoever fights! Get out! 
Let’s sing a heart-felt chorus, drink and shout! 
Up! Hurray! Ha!  
Altmayer 
 
           Ah! I’m in agony! 
Earplugs, here! This fellow’s deafened me.  
Siebel 
 
It’s only when it echoes in the tower,      2085 
You hear a bass voice’s real power. 
 
Frosch 
 
Right, out with him who takes offence! 
Ah! Do, re, me! 
 
Altmayer 
 
Ah! Do, re, me! 
 
Fosch 
 
Our throats are tuned: commence. 
 
(He sings .) 
 
‘Dear Holy Roman Empire,       2090 
How do you hold together?’  
Brander 
 
A lousy song! Bah! A political song - A tiresome song! Thank God, every morning, 
It isn’t you who must sit there worrying 
About the Empire! At least I’m better for     2095 Not being a King or a Chancellor. 
But we should have a leader, so 
We’ll choose a Pope of our own. You know the qualities that can 
Swing the vote, and elevate the man.      2100 
 Frosch (Sings .) 
 
‘Sing away, sweet Nightingale, 
Greet my girl, and never fail.’  
Siebel 
 
Don’t greet my girl! I’ll not allow it! 
 
Frosch 
 
Greet and kiss her! You’ll not stop it! 
 
(He sings. ) 
 ‘Slip the bolt in deepest night!       2105 
Slip it! Wake, the lover bright. 
Slip it to! At break of dawn.’  
Siebel 
 
Yes, sing in praise of her, and boast: sing on! 
I’ll laugh later when it suits: 
She leads me a dance, she’ll lead you too.     2110 She should have a dwarf for a lover! 
At the crossroads, let him woo her: 
An old goat from Blocksberg, galloping over, Can bleat goodnight, as it passes by her. An honest man, of flesh and blood,      2115 
For a girl like that’s far too good. 
I’m not bothered even to say hello Except perhaps to break her window. 
 
Brander  (Pounding on the table .) 
 
Quiet! Quiet! Or you won’t hear! 
I know about life, you lot, confess.      2120 Besotted persons sit among us, 
As fits their status, then, I must 
Give them, tonight, of my very best. Listen! A song in the newest strain! And you can shout out the refrain!      2125  
 
(He sings .)  
‘Once there was a cellar rat, 
Who lived on grease, and butter: 
He had a belly, round and fat, Just like Doctor Luther. 
The cook set poison round about:      2130 
It brought on such a violent bout, As if he’d love inside him.’  
Chorus  (Shouting .) 
 ‘As if he’d love inside him!’ 
 
Brander 
 
‘He ran here, and he ran there, 
And drank from all the puddles,       2135 Gnawing, scratching, everywhere, 
But nothing cured his shudders. 
In torment, he leapt to the roof, Poor beast, soon he’d had enough, 
As if he’d love inside him.’       2140 
 
Chorus 
 
‘As if he’d love inside him!’ 
 
Brander 
 
‘Fear drove him to the light of day, 
Into the kitchen then he ran, 
Fell on the hearth and twitched away, 
Pitifully weak, and wan.        2145 Then the murderess laughed with glee: 
He’s on his last legs, I see, 
As if he’d love inside him.’  
Chorus 
 
‘As if he’d love inside him.’  
Siebel 
 
How pleased they are, the tiresome fools!     2150  
Spreading poison for wretched rats, 
To me, that’s the right thing to do! 
 
Brander 
 
You’re in sympathy with them, perhaps? 
 
Altmayer 
 
That fat belly with a balding head! Bad luck makes him meek and mild:      2155 
From a swollen rat, he  sees, with dread, 
His own natural likeness is compiled.  
(Faust and Mephistopheles appear .) 
 First of all, I had to bring you here, 
Where cheerful friends sup together, 
To see how happily life slips away.      2160 For these folk every day’s a holiday. With lots of leisure, and little sense, 
They revolve in their round-dance, 
Chasing their tails as kittens prance, If the hangovers aren’t too intense,      2165 
If the landlord gives them credit, 
They’re cheerful, and unworried by it.  
Brander 
 
They’re fresh from their travelling days, 
You can tell by their foreign ways: 
They’ve not been back an hour: you see.      2170 Frosch 
 
True, you’re right! My Leipzig’s dear to me! 
It’s a little Paris, and educates its people.  
Siebel 
 
Who do you think the strangers are? 
 
Frosch 
 
Let me find out! I’ll draw the truth, 
From those two, with a brimming glass,     2175 
As easily as you’d pull a child’s tooth. It seems to me they’re  of some noble house, 
They look so discontented and so proud. 
 
Brander 
 
They’re surely strolling players, I’d guess! 
 
Altmayer 
 
Perhaps. 
 
Frosch 
 
      Watch me screw it out of them, then!     2180 
 
Mephistopheles (To Faust .) 
 
These folk wouldn’t f eel the devil, even 
If he’d got them dangling by the neck.  
Faust 
 
Greetings, sirs! Siebel 
 
   Thank you, and greetings.   
 
(He mutters away, inspecti ng Mephistopheles side-on .)  
 
What’s wrong with his foot: why’s he limping?  
Mephistopheles 
 
Allow us to sit with you, if you please.     2185 
Instead of fine ale that can’t be had, 
We can still have good company. 
 
Altmayer 
 
You seem a choosy sort of lad.  
Frosch 
 
Was it late when you started out from Rippach? 
Perhaps you dined with Hans there, first?     2190 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
We passed straight by, today, without a rest! 
We spoke to him last some time back, When he talked a lot about his cousins, 
And he sent to each his kind greetings. 
 (He bows to Frosch .) 
 
Altmayer  (Aside .) 
 
He did you, there! He’s smart! 
 
Siebel 
 
   A shrewd customer!      2195 
 Frosch 
 
Wait, I’ll have him soon, I’m sure! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
If I’m not wrong, we heard 
A tuneful choir singing? I’m sure, with this vault, the words 
Must really set it ringing!        2200 
 
Frosch 
 
Are you by any chance a virtuoso? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
No! Though my desire is great , my skill is only so-so. 
 
Altmayer 
 
Give us a song! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
If you wish it, a few. 
 
Siebel 
 
So long as it’s a brand-new one! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Well, it’s from Spain that we’ve just come,     2205 
The lovely land of wine, and singing too. 
 (He sings .) 
 
‘There was once a king, who 
Had a giant flea’ –  
Frosch 
 
Listen! Did you get that? A flea. 
A flea’s an honest guest to me.       2210 
 
Mephistopheles  (Sings .) 
 ‘There was once a king, who 
Had a giant flea, 
He loved him very much, oh, He was like a son, you see. 
The king called for his tailor,       2215 
He came right away: Now, measure up the lad for  
A suit of clothes, I say!’ 
 
Brander 
 
Make sure the tailor’s sharp, 
And cuts them out precisely,       2220 
And, since his son’s dear to his heart, 
Make sure there’s never a crease to see.   
Mephistopheles 
 
‘All in silk and velvet, 
He was smartly dressed, 
With ribbons on his coat,        2225 
A cross upon his chest. He was the First Minister, 
And so he wore a star: 
His brothers and his sisters, He made noblest by far.        2230  
The lords and the ladies, 
They were badly smitten, 
The Queen and her maids, They were stung and bitten. 
They didn’t dare to crush them,       2235 
Or scratch away, all night. We smother them, and crush them, The moment that they bite.’ 
 
Chorus  (Shouted .) 
 
‘We smother them, and crush them, 
The moment that they bite.’       2240  
Frosch 
 
Bravo! Bravo! That went sweetly! 
 
Siebel 
 
So shall it be with every flea! 
 
Brander 
 
Sharpen your nails, and crush them fine! 
 
Altmayer 
 
Long live freedom, and long live wine! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I’d love to drink a glass, in freedom’s honour,    2245 
If only the wine we re a little better. 
 
Siebel 
 
Not again, we don’t want to hear! 
 Mephistopheles 
 
I fear the landlord might complain 
Or I’d give these worthy guests, One of my cellar’s very best.       2250 
 
Siebel 
 
Just bring it on! He’ll accept it: I’ll explain. 
 
Frosch 
 
Make it a good glass and we’ll praise it. 
But don’t make it so small we can’t taste it. Because if I’m truly going to decide, 
I need a really big mouthful inside.      2255 
 Altmayer  (Aside .) 
 
They’re from the Rhine, as I guessed.  
Mephistopheles 
 
Bring me a corkscrew! 
 
Brander 
 
              What for? 
Is it outside already, this cask? 
 
Altmayer 
 
There’s one in the landlord’s toolbox, for sure. 
 
Mephistopheles (Takes the corkscrew. To Frosch .) 
 Now, what would you like to try?      2260 Frosch 
 
What? Is there a selection, too? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
There’s a choice for every one of you.  Altmayer (To Frosch .) 
 
Ah! You soon catch on: your lips are dry?  
Frosch 
 
Good! When I’ve a choice, I drink Rhenish. 
The Fatherland grants those best gifts to us.     2265 
 Mephistopheles (Boring a hole in the table-edge where Frosch is sitting .) 
 
Bring me a little wax, to ma ke the seals, as well! 
 
Altmayer 
 
Ah, that’s for the conjuring trick, I can tell. 
 
Mephistopheles  (To Brander .) 
 And yours? 
 
Brander 
 
       Champagne for me is fine:  
Make it a truly sparkling wine!  
(Mephistopheles bores the holes: one of the others makes the wax stoppers 
and stops the holes with them .)  We can’t always shun what’s foreign,      2270 
Things from far away are often fine. 
Real Germans can’t abide a Frenchman, 
And yet they gladly drink his wine.  
Siebel (As Mephistopheles approaches his seat .) 
 
I must confess I do dislike the dry, 
Give me a glass of the very sweetest!      2275 
 
Mephistopheles  (Boring a hole .) 
 
I’ll pour an instant Tokay for you, yes? 
 
Altmayer 
 
Now, gentlemen, look me in the eye! 
I see you’ve had the better of us there. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Now! Now! With guests so rare, 
That would be far too much for me to dare.     2280 Quick! Time for you to declare! Which wine can I serve you with? 
 
Altmayer 
 
Any at all! Don’t make us ask forever. 
 (Now all the holes have been stopped and sealed .)  
Mephistopheles (With a strange gesture .) 
 
Grapes, they are the vine’s load! Horns, they are the he-goat’s:       2285 
Wine is juice: wood makes vines, 
The wooden board shall give us wine. Look deeper into Nature! Have faith, and here’s a wonder! 
Now draw the stoppers, and drink up!      2290 
 All (Draw the stoppers, and the wine they  chose flows into each glass .) 
 
O lovely fount, that flows for us!  
Mephistopheles 
 
But careful, don’t lose a drop! 
 
(They drink repeatedly .) 
 
All (Singing. ) 
 ‘We’re all of us cannibals now, We’re like five hundred sows.’ 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
The folk are free, and we can go, you see!     2295 
 
Faust 
 
I’d like to leave here now.  
Mephistopheles 
 
Watch first: their bestiality 
Will make a splendid show. 
 Siebel  
 
(He drinks carelessly, wine pours on the ground and bursts into flame. ) 
 Help! Fire! Hell burns bright! 
 
Mephistopheles (Charming away the flame .) 
 Friendly element, be quiet!       2300 
 
(To the drinkers .) 
 
For this time, just a drop of Purgatory. 
 
Siebel 
 
What’s that? You wait! You’ll pay dearly! 
It seems you don’t quite see us right. 
 
Frosch 
 
Try playing that trick a second time, on us! 
 
Altmayer 
 
I think we should quietly send him packing.     2305 
 
Siebel 
 
What, sir? You think you’re daring, 
Tricking us with your hocus-pocus? 
 
Mephistopheles  
Be quiet, old wine-barrel! 
 
Siebel 
 
You broomstick! You’ll s how us you’re ill bred? 
 Brander 
 
Just wait, it’ll rain blows, on your head!     2310 
 Altmayer (Draws a stopper and fire blazes in his face .) 
 
I’m burning! Burning!  
Siebel 
 
           It’s magic, strike! 
The man’s a rascal! Ki ck him as you like! 
 
(They draw knives and rush at Mephistopheles .) 
 
Mephistopheles (With solemn gestures .) 
 Word and Image, ensnare! 
Alter, senses and air! 
Be here, and there!         2315 
 
 
(They look at each other, amazed .) 
 
Altmayer 
 
Where am I? What a lovely land! 
 
Frosch 
 
Vineyards? Am I seeing straight? 
 
Siebel 
 
And, likewise, grapes to hand!  
Brander 
 
Deep in this green arbour, here, 
See, the vines! What grapes appear! 
 
(He grasps Siebel by the nose: the ot hers do the same reciprocally, and raise 
their knives .) 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
From their eyes, Error, take the iron band,     2320 
And let them see how the Devil plays a joke. 
 (He vanishes with Faust: the revellers separate .) 
 
Siebel 
 
What’s happening? 
 
Altmayer 
   And how? 
 
Frosch 
     Was that your nose? 
 
Brander  (To Siebel .) 
 
And I’ve still got your nose in my hand! 
 
Altmayer 
 
It was a tremor, that passed through every limb! Pass me a stool: I’m sinking in!       2325 
 
Frosch 
 
Tell me: what happened there, my friend? Siebel 
 
Where is he? When I catch that fellow, 
He won’t leave here alive again! 
 
Altmayer 
 
I saw him myself fly out of the cellar 
Riding on a barrel – and then –       2330 
I feel there’s lead still in my feet. 
 (He turns towards the table .) 
 
Ah! Does the wine still flow as sweet? 
 
Siebel 
 
It was deception, cheating, lying. 
 
Frosch 
 
Still, it seemed that I drank wine. 
 
Brander 
 
And what about all those grapes that hung there?    2335 
 
Altmayer 
 
Tell me, now, we shouldn’t believe in wonders!  
Part I Scene VI: The Witches’ Kitchen 
 
(A giant cauldron stands on a low he arth, with a fire under it. Various 
shapes appear in the fumes from the c auldron. A She-Ape sits next to it, 
skimming it, watching to see it doesn’t  boil over. The He-Ape, with young 
ones, sits nearby warming himself. The ceiling and walls are covered with 
the Witches’ grotesque instruments .) 
 Faust 
 
These magical wild b easts repel me, too! 
Are you telling me I can be renewed, 
Wandering around in this mad maze, Demanding help from some old hag:      2340 
That her foul cookery will spirit away 
Thirty years from my age, just like that? 
It’s sad, if you know of nothing better! 
The star of hope has quickly set. 
Hasn’t some noble mind, or Nature,      2345 Found some wondrous potion yet? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
My friend, what you say, again, is intelligent! 
There’s a natural mean s to make you younger: 
But it’s written, in a book quite different, And in an odd chapter.        2350 
 
Faust 
 
I’ll know it, then. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Fine! You’ve a method here that needs 
No gold, no doctor, no magician: Take yourself off to the nearest field, 
To scratch around, and hoe, and dig in, 
Maintain yourself, and constrain       2355 Your senses in a narrow sphere: 
Feed yourself on the purest fare, 
Be a beast among beasts: think it no robbery, 
To manure the fields you harvest, there: Since that’s the best of ways, believe me,      2360 
To keep your youth for eighty years! 
 
Faust 
 
I’m not used to it, can’t condescend, 
To take a spade in hand, and bend: That narrow life wouldn’t suit me at all. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
So you must call the witch then, after all.     2365 
 
Faust 
 
Why is that old witch necessary! 
Why can’t you, yourself, make the brew? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
What a lovely occupation for me! 
And build a thousand bridges, meanwhile, too. 
It’s not just art and science that tell,      2370 Patience is needed in the work as well. 
A calm mind’s busy years in its creation, 
Only time strengthens the fermentation . 
And everything about it 
Is quite a peculiar show!        2375 
It’s true the Devil taught it: The Devil can’t make it though. 
 
(Seeing the creatures .) 
 See what a dainty race I hail! 
This is the female: this is the male! 
 (To the creatures .) 
 
The mistress isn’t home, I say?       2380 
 
The Creatures 
 
Feasting away, 
Gone today, The Chimney way! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
How long will she be swarming? 
 
The Creatures 
 
As long as our paws are warming.      2385 
 
Mephistopheles  (To Faust .) 
 What do you think of these tender creatures? 
 
Faust 
 
As rude as any I ever saw! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Ah, but to me this kind of discourse  
Shows the most delightful features!  
(To the creatures .) 
 Accursed puppets, tell me true,       2390 
What are you stirring in that brew? 
 
The Creatures 
 
We’re cooking up th ick beggars’ soup. 
 Mephistopheles 
 
Then there’ll be thousands in the queue. 
 The He-Ape  (Approaches and fawns on Mephistopheles .) 
 
O, throw the dice quick, And let me be rich!        2395 I’ll be the winner! 
It’s all arranged badly, 
And if I had money, I’d be a thinker. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Why does the ape think he’d be lucky,      2400 
If he’d only a chance to try the lottery!  
(Meanwhile the young apes have been pl aying with a large ball, and they 
roll it forward .) 
 
The He-Ape 
 
The world’s a ball 
It lifts to fall, 
Rolls without rest: 
Rings like glass,         2405 And breaks as fast! 
It’s hollow at best. 
It’s shining here, Here, what’s more: 
‘I am living!’         2410 
A place dear son, To keep far from! 
You must die! 
Its clay will soon In pieces, lie.         2415 Mephistopheles 
 
Why the sieve? 
 The He-Ape  (Lifting it down .) 
 
If you were a thief I’d know you this minute.  
(He runs to the She-Ape, and le ts her look through the sieve .) 
 Look through the sieve!        2420 
Can you see the thief, 
But daren’t name him?  
Mephistopheles (Approaching the fire .) 
 And this pot? 
 
The He-Ape and She-Ape 
 
What a silly lot! 
Not to know a pot, Not to know a kettle!        2425  
Mephistopheles 
 
Rude creature! 
 
The He-Ape 
 
Take this brush here, 
And sit on the settle.  
(He invites Mephistopheles to sit down .)  
Faust  (Who all this time has been standing in front of a mirror, alternately 
approaching it and distancing himself from it .) 
 What do I see? What heavenly form 
Is this that the magic mirror brings!      2430 
Love, lend me your swiftest wings, Then bear me to fields she adorns! Ah, if I do not stand still here, 
If I dare to venture nearer, 
I see as if through a mist, no clearer –      2435 The loveliest form of Woman, there! 
Is it possible: can Woman be so lovely? 
Must I, in her outspread body, declare The incarnation of all that’s heavenly? 
Can any such this earth deliver?       2440 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Naturally, if a God torments himself six days, 
And says to himself, Bravo , at last,  in praise, 
He must have made something  clever. 
See, this time, what w ill satisfy you, forever: 
I’ll know how to fish that treasure out for you,    2445 Happy, the one who finds good fortune in her, 
And carries her home again, as his bride, too. 
 (Faust gazes endlessly in the mirror. Mephistopheles stretc hes himself on the 
settle, plays with the brush, and continues to speak .) 
 Here I sit like a king on his throne, 
The sceptre’s here, but where’s the crown? 
 
The Creatures (Who up till now have been making all kinds of grotesque 
movements together, bring Mephistopheles a crown, with great outcry .) 
 Oh, with sweat and with blood,       2450 If you’ll be so good, 
Glue on this crown, sublime! 
 (They are awkward with the crown, and snap it in two pieces, with which 
they leap about .) 
 
Now that’s out of the way! 
We see, and we say, 
We hear, and we rhyme -        2455 
 Faust  (In front of the mirror .) 
 
Ah! I’ll go completely mad. 
 Mephistopheles  (Pointing to the creatures .) 
 
Now my head’s almost spinning. 
 
The Creatures 
 
If our luck’s not bad, 
If there’s sense to be had, 
We must be thinking!        2460  
Faust  (As before .) 
 My heart pains me with  its burning! Quick, 
Let’s leave this place, forego it! 
 
Mephistopheles (Still in the same position .) 
 
Well, at least one must admit 
That they’re honest  poets. 
 
(The cauldron that the She-Ape has for gotten to keep a watch on, now boils 
over: a great flame flares from the chimney. The Witch comes careering 
down through the flames, with horrendous cries. ) 
 
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!        2465 Damned creature! Accursed sow! 
You left the kettle: y ou’ve singed me now! 
Accursed creature! 
 (Seeing Faust and Mephistopheles .) 
 
What have we here? 
Who are you, here?        2470 What do you want? 
Who creeps unknown? 
The fire’s pain own In all your bone!  
(She plunges the skimming-ladle into  the cauldron, and scatters flame 
towards Faust, Mephistopheles and the Creatures. The Creatures whimper .) 
 
Mephistopheles  (Reversing the brush he holds in his hand, and striking 
among the jars and glasses .) 
 
One, two! One, two! 
There lies the brew! There lies the glass! 
A joke at last, 
In time, she-ass, To your melody, too.         2480 
 
(As the Witch starts back in Anger and Horror .) 
 Do you know me? Skeleton! Scarecrow! 
Do you know your lord and master? 
What stops me from striking you, so, Crushing you, and your ape-creatures? 
Have you no respect for a scarlet coat?     2485 
Don’t you understand a co ckerel’s feather? 
Have I hidden my face, you old she-goat? 
Have I to name myself, as ever? 
 
The Witch 
 
Oh sir, forgive the rude welcome! 
I don’t see a single foot cloven.       2490 And your two ravens - are where?  Mephistopheles 
 
This once, you get away with it: 
It’s truly a good while, isn’t it, Since we’ve been seen together. 
And Civilisation makes men level,      2495 
It even sticks to the Devil:   That Northern demon is no more: Who sees horns now, or tail or claw? 
As for the feet, which I can’t spare, 
That would harm me with the people.      2500 So like many a youth, now, I wear, 
False calves and false in-steps, as well. 
 The Witch (Dancing .) 
 
Sense and reason flee my brain, 
I see young Satan here again! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Woman, I forbid that name!       2505 
 
The Witch 
 
Why? What harm is caused so? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
It’s written in story books, always: 
Men are no better for it, though: 
The Evil One’s gone: the evil stays. 
Call me the Baron: that sounds good:      2510 I’m a gentleman, like the other gentlemen. 
Perhaps you doubt my noble blood: 
See, here’s the crest I carry, then!  (He makes an indecent gesture .)  
 The Witch  (Laughing immoderately .) 
 
Ha! Ha! That’s your way, as ever. 
You’re the same rogue forever!       2515  
Mephistopheles (To Faust .) 
 
My friend, take note: learn that this is 
The proper way to handle witches. 
 
The Witch 
 
Now, gentlemen, say how I can be of use. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
A good glass of your well-known juice! 
But I must insist on the oldest:       2520 
The years double what it can do. 
 The Witch  
 
Gladly! Here’s a flask, on the shelf: I sometimes drink from it myself, And it doesn’t really stink at all: 
I’ll gladly give him a glass or so.      2525 
 (Whispering .) 
 
If he drinks it unprepared, recall, He won’t live a single hour, though. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
He’s my good friend: it’ll go down well: 
Don’t begrudge the best  of your kitchen. 
Draw the circle: speak th e speech, then     2530 
Offer him a glass full! 
 (The Witch draws a circle with fantas tic gestures, and places mysterious 
articles inside it: meanwhile the glasses start to ring, and the cauldron to 
echo, and make music. Finally she brings  a large book, sits the Apes in a 
ring, who serve as a reading desk and hold torches. She beckons Faust to 
approach .) 
 
Faust  (To Mephistopheles .) 
 Tell me, now, what’s happening? 
These wild gestures, crazy things, 
All of this tasteless trickery, Is known, and hateful enough to me.      2535 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
A farce! You should be laughing: 
Don’t be such a serious fellow! This hocus-pocus she, the doctor’s, making, 
So you’ll be aided by the juice to follow. 
 (He persuades Faust to enter the circle .) 
 
The Witch (Begins to declaim from the book, with much emphasis .) 
 You shall see, then!        2540 
From one make ten! 
Let two go again, Make three even, 
You’re rich again. 
Take away four!         2545 From five and six, 
So says the Witch, 
Make seven and eight, So it’s full weight: 
And nine is one,         2550 
And ten is none. This is the Witch’s one-times-one! Faust 
 
I’m in the dark, the hag babbles with fever. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
There’s still more she’s not gone over, 
I know it well, the whole book’s like this:     2555 I’ve wasted time on it before, though, 
A perfect contradiction in terms is 
Ever a mystery to the wise: fools more so. My friend, the art’s both old and new, 
It’s like this in every age, with two      2560 
And one, and one and two, Scattering error instead of truth. 
Men prattle, and te ach it undisturbed: 
Who wants to be counted with the fools? Men always believe, when they hear words,     2565 
There must be thought behind them, too. 
 The Witch  (Continuing .) 
 
The highest skill, The science, still Is hidden from the rabble! 
One who never thought,        2570 
To him it’s brought, He owns it without trouble. 
 
Faust 
 
Why talk this nonsense to us? 
My head’s near split in two. It seems I hear the chorus,       2575 
Of a hundred thousand fools. Mephistopheles 
 
Enough, enough, O excellent Sibyl! 
Bring the drink along: and fill The cup, quick, to the very brim: 
The drink will bring my friend no harm:     2580 
He’s a man of many parts, and him Many a noble draught has charmed.  
(The Witch, ceremoniously, pours the drink in to a cup: as Faust puts it to his 
lips, a gentle flame rises. ) 
 
Down it quickly! Every time! It’ll 
Likewise, warm your heart, entire. You’re hand in hand with  the Devil:      2585 
Will you shrink before the fire?  
 (The Witch breaks the circle. Faust steps out .) 
 
Now, quick, away! You may not rest.  
 
The Witch 
 
Much good may that potion do you! 
 
Mephistopheles  (To the Witch .) 
 On Walpurgis Night you can tell me best, 
What favour I can return to you.      2590 
 
The Witch 
 
Here’s a song! Sing it sometimes, and you, 
Will feel a peculiar effect: don’t ask me how. 
 
Mephistopheles  (To Faust .) 
 Come on, quickly, run about now: 
You need to sweat, that will allow 
The power to penetrate, through and through.    2595 Later, I’ll teach you to value leisure, 
And soon you’ll find with deepest pleasure, 
How Cupid stirs, and, now and then, leaps, too. 
 
Faust 
 
Let me look quickly in the glass, once more! How lovely that woman’s form, I descried!     2600  
Mephistopheles 
 
No! No! The paragon of all women, you’re 
About to see before  you, personified. 
 (Aside .) 
 
With that drink in your body, well then, All women will look to you like Helen. Part I Scene VII: A Street 
 
(Faust. Margaret, passing by .) 
 
Faust 
 
Lovely lady, may I offer you       2605 
My arm, and my protection, too?  
Margaret 
 
Not lovely, nor the lady you detected, 
I can go home, unprotected. 
 (She releases herself and exits .) 
 
Faust 
 
By Heavens, the child is lovely! 
I’ve never seen anything more so.      2610 She’s virtuous, yet innocently  
Pert, and quick-tongued though. 
Her rosy lips, her clear cheeks, I’ll not forget them in many a week! The way she cast down her eyes,      2615 
Deep in my heart, imprinted, lies: 
How curt in her speech she was, Well that was quite ch arming, of course! 
 
(Mephistopheles enters .) 
 
Listen, you must get that girl for me! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Which one? Faust 
  The girl who just went by.     2620 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
That one, there? She’s come from the priest, 
Absolved of all her sins, while I Crept into a stall nearby: She is such an innocent thing, 
She’s no need to sit confessing:       2625 
I’ve no power with such as those, I mean!  
Faust 
 
Yet, she’s older than fourteen. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Now you’re speaking like some Don Juan 
Who wants every flower for himself alone, Conceited enough to think th ere’s no honour,    2630 
To be plucked except by him, nor favour: 
But that’s never the case, you know.  
Faust 
 
Master Moraliser is that so? With me, best leave morality alone! 
I’m telling you, short and sweet,      2635 
If that young heart doesn’t beat Within my arms, tonight - so be it, 
At midnight, then our pact is done. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Think, what a to and fro it will take! 
I need at least fourteen days, to make      2640 Some kind of opportunity to meet her. 
   
 Faust 
 
If I’d seven hours at my call, 
I’d not need the Devil at all, 
To seduce such a creature. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
You’re almost talking like a Frenchman:     2645 
But don’t let yourself  get all annoyed: 
What’s the use if she’s only part enjoyed? 
Your happiness won’t be as prolonged, 
As if you were to knead and fashion That little doll, with every passion,       2650 
Up and down, as yearning preaches, 
And many a cunning rascal teaches.  
 
Faust 
 
I’ve enough appetite without all that. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Now, without complaint or jesting, what 
I’m telling you is, with this lovely child,     2655 
Once and for all, you mustn’t be wild. She won’t be taken by storm, I said: 
We’ll need to use cunning instead. 
 
Faust 
 
Get me a part of the angels’ treasure! 
Lead me to where she lies at leisure!       2660 
Get me a scarf from her neck: aspire 
To a garter, that’s my heart’s desire.  
Mephistopheles 
 
So you can see how I will strain 
To help you, and ease your pain, 
We’ll not let an instant slip away,      2665 
I’ll lead you to her room today.  
Faust 
 
And shall I see her?  And have her? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
No! She has to visit a neighbour. 
Meanwhile, you can be alone there, 
With every hope of future pleasure,      2670 Enjoy her breathing space, at leisure. 
 
Faust 
 
Can we go? 
 
Mephistopheles 
   
     Her room’s not yet free. 
 
Faust 
 
Look for a gift for her, from me! 
 
(He exits .) 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
A present? Good! He’s sure to work it! 
I know many a lovely place, up here,      2675 And many an ancient buried treasure: 
I must have a look around for a bit. 
(He exits .) Part I Scene VIII: Evening,  
A small well-kept room. 
 
(Margaret, plaiting and fastening the braids of her hair .) 
 
Margaret 
 
I’d give anything if I could say 
Who that gentleman was, today! 
He’s brave for certain, I could see,      2680 
And from some noble family: That his face readily told – 
Or he wouldn’t have been so bold.   
 (She exits .) (Mephistopheles and Faust appear .) 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Come in: but quietly, I mean! 
 Faust (After a moment’s silence .) 
 
I’d ask you, now, to leave me be!      2685  Mephistopheles  (Poking about .) 
 
Not every girl keeps thing so clean.   
 
(Mephistopheles exits. ) 
 
Faust 
 
Welcome, sweet twilight glow, 
That weaves throughout this shrine! 
Sweet love-pangs gr ip my heart so, 
That on hope’s dew must live, and pine!     2690 How a breath of peace breathes around, Its order, and contentment! 
In this poverty, what wealth is found! 
In this prison, what enchantment!  
(He throws himself into a leather armchair near the bed .) 
 
Accept me now, you, who with open arms      2695 Gathered joy and pain, in past days, where, 
How often, ah, with all their childish charms  
The little flock hung round their father’s chair! There my beloved, perhap s, cheeks full, stands, 
Grateful for all the gifts of Christmas fare,     2700 
Kissing her grandfather’s withered hands. 
Sweet girl, I feel your spirit, softly stray, Through the wealth of order, all around me, 
That with motherliness instructs, each day, 
The tablecloth to lie smooth, at your say,     2705 And even the wrinkled sand beneath your feet. 
O beloved hand, so goddess-like! 
This house because of you is Heaven’s like. And here! 
 
(He lifts one of the bed curtains .) 
 
  What grips me with its bliss! 
Here I could stand, slowly lingering.      2710 Here, Nature, in its gentlest dreaming, Formed an earthly angel within this. 
Here the child lay! Life, warm, 
Filled her delicate breast,  And here, in pure and holy form,      2715 
A heavenly image was expressed! 
And I! What leads me here? Why do I feel so deeply stirred? 
What do I seek? Why such a heavy heart? 
Poor Faust! I no longer know who you are.     2720 Is there a magic fragrance round me? 
I urged myself on, to the deepest delight, 
And feel myself melt in Love’s dreaming flight! Are we the sport of every lightest breeze? And if she appeared at this instant,      2725 
How to atone for being so indiscreet? 
The great man, alas, of little moment! Would lie here, melting, at her feet. 
 
Mephistopheles  (Appearing .) 
 Quick! I see her coming, there. 
 
Faust 
 
Away! Away! I’ll not return again.      2730 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Here’s a casket fa irly loaded, then, 
I’ve taken it from elsewhere. Put it just here on the chest, 
I swear it’ll dazzle her, when she sees: 
I’ve put in some trinkets, and the rest,      2735 For you to win another, if you please.  
Truly, a child’s a child, and play is play. 
 
Faust 
 
I don’t know, shall I? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
       Are you asking, pray? 
Perhaps you’d like to k eep the treasure, too? 
Then I’d advise your Lustfulness,      2740 
To spare the sweet hours of brightness, And spare me a heap of trouble over you.  
I hope that you’re not full of meanness! 
I scratch my head: I rub my hands –   
(He places the casket in the chest, and shuts it again .) 
 Now off we go, and go quickly!       2745 Through this you’ll bend the child, you see, 
To your wish and will: as any fool understands: 
Yet now you seem to me As if you were heading for the lecture hall, and see 
Standing there grey-faced, in front of you,     2750 
Physics, and Metaphysics too! 
Now, away!  
(They exit .) 
 (Margaret with a lamp .) 
 
Margaret 
 
It’s so close and sultry, here, 
 
(She opens the window .) 
 
And yet it’s not warm outside. 
It troubles me so, I don’t know why –      2755 I wish that Mother were near. 
A shudder ran through my whole body – 
I’m such a foolish girl, so timid!  
(She begins to sing, while undressing. ) 
 ‘There was a king in Thule, he Was faithful, to the grave,       2760 
To whom his dying lady 
A golden goblet gave.  
He valued nothing greater: 
At every feast it shone: His tears were brimming over,       2765 
When he drank there-from. 
 When he himself was dying 
No towns did he with-hold, 
No wealth his heir denying, Except the cup of gold.        2770  
He gave a r oyal banquet, 
His knights around him, all, 
In his sea-girt turret, In his ancestral hall. 
 
There the old king stood, yet,       2775 Drinking life’s last glow: Then threw the golden goblet 
Into the waves below. 
 He saw it falling, drowning, 
Sinking in the sea,         2780 
Then, his eyelids closing, Never again drank he.’ 
 
(She opens the chest in order to arra nge her clothes, and sees the casket .) 
 
How can this lovely cas ket be here? I’m sure 
I locked the chest when I was here before. It’s quite miraculous! What can it hold in store?    2785 
Perhaps someone brought it as security, 
And my mother’s granted a loan on it? There’s a ribbon hanging from it, there’s a key, I’m quite determined to open it. 
What’s here? Heavens! What a show,      2790 
More than I’ve ever s een in all my days! 
A jewel box! A noble lady might glow 
With all of these on high holidays! 
How would this chain look? This display  Of splendour: who owns it, it’s so fine?     2795 
 
(She puts the jewellery on and stands in front of the mirror .) 
 
If only the earrings were mine! 
At once one looks so different. What makes us beautiful, young blood? All that’s fine and good, 
But it’s discounted, in the end,       2800 
They praise us half in pity. To gold they tend, 
On gold depend, 
All things! Oh, poverty!   Part I Scene IX: Promenade 
 
(Faust walking about pensively. Mephistopheles appears .) 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Scorned by all love! And by hellfire! What’s worse?   2805 I wish I knew: I could use it in a curse!  
Faust 
 
What’s wrong? What’s pinching you so badly? 
I never, in all my lif e, saw such a face! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I’d pack myself off to the Devil, in disgrace, 
If I weren’t a Devil myself already!      2810 
 
Faust 
 
Is something troubling your brain? 
It’s fitting that you’ve a raging pain.  
Mephistopheles 
 
To think, the priest should get his hands on 
Jewellery that was meant for Gretchen! 
Her mother snatched it up, to see,      2815 
And was gripped by secret anxiety. That woman’s a marvellous sense of smell, 
From nosing round in her prayer-book too well, 
And sniffs things, ever and again, To see if they’re holy or profane:      2820 
And about the jewels, she felt, that’s clear, 
There’s not much of a blessing here. ‘My child,’ she said, ‘ill-gotten goods Snare the soul, and dissipate the blood. 
We’ll dedicate it to the Virgin,       2825 
She’ll repay us with manna from Heaven!’ Margaret, grimacing wryly, was quite put out: 
Thinking: ‘Don’t look a gift horse in the mouth, 
He’s not a godless man, nor one to fear, 
He who left these fine things here.’      2830 Her mother let the parson in: 
He’d scarcely let the game begin 
Before his eyes filled with enjoyment.  He said: ‘So we see aright, we sinners, Who overcome themselves are winners.     2835 
The Church has a healthy stomach, when, 
It gobbles up lands, and don’t forget, It’s never over-eaten yet. 
The Church alone, dear lady, could 
Always digest ill-gotten goods.’       2840  
Faust 
 
That’s a universal custom, too, my friend, 
With all those who rule, and those who lend. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Then he took the bangles, chains and rings, As if they were me rely trifling things, 
Thanked her too, no less nor more      2845 
Than if it were a sack of nuts one wore. 
Promised them their reward when they died, And left them suitably edified. 
 
Faust 
 
And Gretchen? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
       Sits there, restlessly, still 
Not knowing what she should do, or will,     2850 Thinks of the jewels night and day, 
But more of him who placed them in her way.  
 Faust 
 
The dear girl’s sadness brings me pain. 
Find some jewels for her, again! Those first were not so fine, I’d say.      2855 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Oh yes, to gentlemen it’s child’s play! 
 
Faust 
 
Fix it: arrange it, as I want you to, 
Attach yourself to her neighbour, too! Don’t be a devil made of clay, 
Get her fresh jewels straight away!      2860 
  
Mephistopheles 
 
Yes, gracious sir, gladly, with all my heart. 
 
(Faust exits .) 
 Such a lovesick fool would blow up the Sun, 
High up in the air, with the Moon and Stars, 
To provide his sweetheart with some diversion.  
(He exits .) Part I Scene X: The Neighbour’s House 
 
Martha  (Alone .) 
 God forgive that man I love so well,      2865 
He hasn’t done right by me at all!  
Off into the world he’s gone, And left me here, in the dust, alone. Truly I did nothing to grieve him, 
I gave him, God knows, fine loving.      2870 
 (She weeps .) 
 
Perhaps, he’s even dead! – Yet, oh! If I’d only his death certificate to show! 
 
(Margaret enters .) 
 
Margaret 
 
Martha! 
 
Martha 
My little Gretchen, what’s happened? 
 
Margaret 
 
My legs are giving way beneath me! 
I’ve found another box of jewellery      2875 
In the chest: it’s of ebony, fashioned, Full of quite splendid things, 
And richer than the first, I think. 
 
Martha 
 
You’d better not tell your mother: 
She’ll give it to the Church, like the other.     2880 Margaret 
 
Ah, See now! See what a show! 
 Martha  (Dressing her with jewels .) 
 
O you’re a lucky creature, though!  
Margaret 
 
I can’t wear them in  the street, alas, 
Nor be seen like this, at Mass. 
 
Martha 
 
Come often then, to me, as before:      2885 
You can put them on, here, secretly: Stand, for an hour, in front of the mirror, 
We’ll take delight in them privately. 
Then give us a holiday, an occasion, When people can see a fraction of them.     2890 
A chain first, then a pearl in the ear: your 
Mother won’t know, say you’d them before.  
Margaret 
 
Who could have left the second casket?  
There’s something not proper about it! 
 
(A knock .) 
 
Good God! Is it my mother, then?      2895 
 Martha  (Looking through the shutter .) 
 
It’s a stranger, a gentleman – Come in! (Mephistopheles enters. ) 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
In introducing myself so freely, 
I ask you ladies to excuse me. 
 (He steps back reverently on seeing Margaret .)  
 
It’s Martha Schwerdtlein I seek! 
 
Martha 
 
I’m she, what do you wish with me?      2900 
 
Mephistopheles (Aside to her .) 
 
I know you now: that’s enough for me: 
You’ve a distinguished visitor there, I see. 
Pardon the liberty I’ve taken, pray, I’ll return this afternoon, if I may. 
 
Martha (Aloud .) 
 To think, child: of all things: just fancy!     2905 
The gentleman take s you for a lady. 
 
Margaret 
 
I’m a poor young thing he’ll find: Heavens! The gentleman’s far too kind: 
The jewels and trinkets aren’t mine. 
 
Mephistopheles  
 
Ah, it’s not just the jewellery, mind:      2910 The look: the manner: she has a way! I’m pleased that I’m allowed to stay. 
 
 Martha 
 
What brings you here? I wish that you – 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I wish I brought you happier news! – 
This news I hope you’ll forgive me repeating:    2915 Your husband’s dead, but sends a greeting. 
 
Martha 
 
He’s dead? That true heart! Oh! 
My man is dead! I’ll die, also!  
Margaret 
 
Ah! Dear lady, don’t despair! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Hear the mournful tale I bear!       2920 
 
Margaret 
 
That’s why I’ll never love while I’ve breath, 
Such a loss would grieve me to death. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Joy must have sorrows: sorrow its joys, too. 
 
Martha 
 
Tell me of his last hours: ah tell me! Mephistopheles 
 
He’s buried in Padua, close to       2925 
The blessed Saint Anthony, In a consecrated space, 
A cool eternal resting place. 
 
Martha 
 
Have you brought nothing else, from him? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Yes a request, it’s large and heavy:      2930 
For you to sing a hundred masses for him! 
Otherwise, no, my pocket’s empty.  
 
Martha 
 
What? No piece of sh ow? No jewellery? 
What every workman has in his purse, 
And keeps with him as his reserve,      2935 
Rather than having to starve or beg!  
Mephistopheles 
 
Madam, it’s a heavy grief to me: 
But truly his money wasn’t wasted. 
And then, he felt his errors greatly, 
Yes, and bemoaned his bad luck lately.     2940  
Margaret  
 
Ah! How unlucky all men are! I’ll 
Be sure to offer many a prayer for him. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
You’re worthy of soon marrying: 
You’re such a kindly child.  
Margaret 
 
Oh, no! That wouldn’t do as yet.      2945 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
If not a husband, a l over, while you wait. 
It’s heaven’s greatest charm, 
To have a dear one on one’s arm. 
 
Margaret 
 
That’s not the custom of the country. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Custom or not! It seems to be.       2950 
 
Martha 
 
Go on with your tale! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
       I stood beside his death-bed, 
Hardly better than a rubbish-tip, poor man, Of half-rotten straw: yet he died a Christian, 
And found that he was even further in debt.  
‘Alas,’ he cried, ‘I hate myself, with good reason,    2955 
For leaving, as I did, my wife and my occupation! 
Ah the memory of that is killing me, 
Would in this life I might be forgiven, though!’  
Martha (Weeping .) 
 The dear man! I forgave him long ago. Mephistopheles 
 
‘Although, God knows, she was more  to blame than me.’   2960 
 
Martha 
 
The liar! What! At death’s door, lies he was telling! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
In his last wanderings, he was rambling, 
If I’m any judge myself of the thing. 
‘I had,’ he said, ‘no time to gaze in play: 
First children, then bread for them each day,     2965 And I mean bread in the wider sense: 
And couldn’t even eat my share in silence.’ 
 
Martha 
 
Did he forget the love, the loyalty, My drudgery, night and day! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Not at all, he thought of it deeply, in his way.    2970 
He said: ‘As I was leaving Malta 
I prayed hard for my wife and children: And favour came to me from heaven, 
Since our ship took a Turkish cutter, 
Carrying the great Sultan’s treasure.      2975 There was a reward for bravery, 
And I received, in due measure, 
The generous share that fell to me.’  
Martha 
 
What? And where? Has he buried it by chance? Mephistopheles 
 
Who can tell: the four winds know the circumstance.   2980 
A lovely girl there took him on, As he, a stranger, roamed round Naples: 
She gave him loyalty,  and loved the man, 
And he felt it so, till his last hour fell.  
Martha 
 
He stole from his children, and his wife!     2985 The rogue! All the pain and misery he met, 
Couldn’t keep him from that shameful life! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Ah, but: now he’s died of it! If I were truly in your place, 
I’d mourn him quietly for a year,      2990 
And look, meanwhile, for a dear new face.  
Martha 
 
Ah, sweet God! I’ll not easily find another, In all the world, such as my first one was! 
There never was a dearer fool than mine. 
Only he loved roaming too much, at last,     2995 And foreign women, and foreign wine, 
And the rolling of those cursed dice. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Well, that would have still been fine, If, with you, he’d followed that line, 
And noticed nothing, on your side.      3000 
I swear that, with that same condition, I’d swap rings with you, no question! Martha 
 
O, the gentleman’s pleased to jest! 
 Mephistopheles (To himself .) 
 
I must fly from here, swift as a bird! She might hold the Devil to his word.      3005  
(To Gretchen .) 
 How does your heart feel? At rest? 
 
Margaret 
 
What does the gentleman mean? 
 Mephistopheles (To himself .) 
 
    Sweet, innocent child!  
(Aloud .) 
 Farewell, ladies!  
Margaret 
  Farewell! 
 
Martha 
   Oh, speak to me yet, a while! 
I’d like a witness, as to  where, how, and when 
My darling man died and was buried: then,     3010 
As I’ve always been a friend of tradition, Put his death in the pape r, the weekly edition.   
Mephistopheles 
 
Yes, dear lady, two witnesses you need  
To verify the truth, or so all agree: 
I’ve a rather fine companion,       3015 
He can be your second man. I’ll bring him here. 
 
Martha 
   Oh yes, please do! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
That young lady will be here, too? 
He’s a brave youth! Travelled, yes, 
And with ladies he’s all politeness.      3020  
Margaret 
 
I’d be shamed before the gentleman. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Not before any king on earth, madam. 
 
Martha 
 
Behind the house, then, in my garden,  
Tonight: we’ll expect you gentlemen. Part I Scene XI: The Street 
 
(Faust. Mephistopheles .) 
 
Faust 
 
How goes it? Will it be? Will it soon be done?    3025 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Ah, bravo! Do I find you all on fire? 
In double-quick time you’ll have your desire. 
You’ll meet tonight, at her neighbour Martha’s home: 
There’s a woman, who’s the thing, For procuring and for gipsying!       3030 
 
Faust 
 
All right! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 But, she needs something from us, too. 
 
Faust 
 
One good turn deserves another, true. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
We only have to bear a valid witness, 
That her husband’s outstretched members bless 
A consecrated place in Padua.       3035 
 
Faust 
 
Brilliant! We must first make the journey there! Mephistopheles 
 
Sacred Simplicity!  There’s no need to do that. 
Just testify, without saying too much to her.  
Faust 
 
If you can’t do better than that, your pact I’ll tear. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
O holy man! Now I see you there!      3040 
Is it the first time in your life, come swear, 
That you’ve ever bo rn false witness? 
Haven’t you shown skill in definition 
Of God, the World, what’s in it, Men, 
What moves them, in mind and breast?     3045 With impudent brow, and swollen chest? 
And if you look at it more deeply, oh yes, 
Did you know as much now - confess, As you do about Herr Schwerdtlein’s death? 
 
Faust 
 
You are, and you’ll remain, a Liar and a Sophist.    3050 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Yes when no one’s the wiser for it. 
This coming morn, in all honour though, Won’t you beguile poor Gretchen so: 
And swear you love her with all your soul? 
 
Faust 
 
From my heart.  
Mephistopheles 
 
   Well, and good!      3055 And will your eternal Truth and Love, 
Your one all-powerful Force, above – 
Flow from your heart, too, as it should?   
Faust 
 
Stop! Stop! It will! If I but feel,  For that emotion, for that throng,      3060 
Seek the name, that none reveal, 
Roam, with senses, through the world. Seize on every highest word, 
And call the fire, that I’m tasting, 
Endless, eternal, everlasting –        3065 Does that to some devil’s game of lies belong?  
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Yet, I’m still right! 
 
Faust 
 
   Hear one thing more,   
I beg you, and spare my breath – the one Who wants to hold fast, and has a tongue, 
He’ll hold for sure.         3070 
Come, chattering fills me with disgust, And then you’re right, especially since I must. Part I Scene XII: The Garden 
 
(Margaret on Faust’s arm, Martha and Mephistopheles walking up and 
down .) 
 
I know the gentleman flatters me, 
Lowers himself, and shames me, too. A traveller is used to being      3075 Content, out of courtesy, with any food. 
I know too well, so learned a man, 
Can’t feed himself on my poor bran.  
Faust 
 
A glance, a word from you, feeds me more, 
Than all the world’s wisest lore.     3080  
 (He kisses her hand .) 
 
Margaret 
 
Don’t trouble yourself! How could you kiss it? 
It’s such a nasty, rough thing! What work haven’t I done with it! My mother’s so exacting. 
 
(They move on .) 
 
Martha 
 
And you, sir, you’re always  travelling?     3085 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Ah, work and duty are such a bother! 
There’s many a place one’s sad at leaving, And daren’t stay a moment longer! Martha 
 
In youth it’s fine, up and down, 
Flitting about, the whole world over:      3090 Then harsher days come round, 
And lonely bachelors small joy discover, 
In sliding towards their hole in the ground.   
Mephistopheles 
 
I view the prospect with horror. 
 
Martha 
 
Then take advice in time, dear sir.      3095 
 
(They move on .) 
 
Margaret 
 
Yes, out of sight is out of mind! 
Politeness comes naturally to you: 
But you’ll meet friends, often, who,  Are more sensible than me, you’ll find.  
Faust 
 
Dearest, believe me, what men call sense,     3100 
Is often just vanity and short-sightedness. 
 
Margaret 
      H o w  s o ?  
 
Faust 
 
Ah, that simplicity a nd innocence never know 
Themselves, or their heavenly worth! That humble meekness, the highest grace 
That Nature bestows so lovingly –      3105 
 Margaret 
 
It’s only for a moment that you think of me, 
I’ve plenty of time to dream about your face. 
 
Faust 
 
You’re often alone, then? 
 
Margaret 
 
Yes, our household’s a little one, 
Yet it has to be cared fo r by someone.      3110 
We have no servant: I sweep, knit, sew, And cook, I’m working early and late: 
And in everything my mother is so 
Strict, and straight. Not that she has to be quite so economical:     3115 
We could be more ge nerous than others: 
My father left a little fortune for us: A house and garden by the town-wall. 
But now my days are spent quietly: 
My brother is a soldier: I’d       3120 A younger sister who died. The trouble I had with that child: 
Yet I’d take it on again, the worry, 
She was so dear to me.  
Faust 
   An angel, if like you. 
 
Margaret 
 
I raised her, and she loved me too.      3125 
After my father died, she was born, 
We gave mother up for lost, so worn And wretchedly she lay there then, And slowly, day by day,  grew well again. 
She couldn’t think of feeding       3130 
It herself: that poor little thing, And so I nursed it all alone, 
On milk and water, as  if it were my own, 
In my arms, in my lap, 
It charmed me, tumbling, and grew fat.     3135  
Faust 
 
You found your greatest happiness there, for sure. 
 
Margaret 
 
But also truly many a weary hour. 
The baby’s cradle stood at night 
Beside my bed: and if it hardly stirred I woke outright:         3140 
Now I nursed it, now laid it beside me: heard 
When it cried, and left  my bed, and often 
Danced it back and forth, in the room: and then, 
At break of dawn stood at the washtub, again:  
Then the market and the kitchen, oh,      3145 And every day just like tomorrow. 
One sometimes lacks the courage, sir, and yet 
One appreciates one’s food and rest.  (They move on .) 
 
Martha 
 
Women have the worst of it: it’s true: 
A bachelor is hard to change, you see.      3150  
Mephistopheles 
 
That just depends on the likes of you, 
The right teacher might improve me. 
 
Martha 
 
Say, have you never f ound anyone, dear sir? 
Has your heart never been captured, anywhere?  
Mephistopheles 
 
The proverb says: A hearth of your own,     3155 
And a good wife, are worth pearls and gold. 
 
Martha 
 
I mean: have you never felt desire, even lightly? 
 
Mephistopheles  
I’ve everywhere been treated most politely. 
 
Martha 
 
I meant to say: were you never seriously  smitten? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
With ladies, one should never dare be flippant.    3160 
 
Martha 
 
Ah, you won’t  understand me! 
 
Mephistopheles 
       I am sorry! Yet you’ll find 
I understand – that you are very kind. 
 (They move on .) 
 
Faust 
 
And, Angel, did you r ecognise me again, 
As soon as I appeared in the garden?  
Margaret 
 
Didn’t you see my gaze drop then?      3165  
Faust 
 
And you forgive the liberty I’ve taken, 
The impertinence of it all, 
Just as you were leaving the Cathedral? 
 
Margaret  
I was flustered, such a th ing’s never happened to me: 
‘Ah’, I thought, ‘has he seen, in your behaviour,    3170 Something that’s impertinent or improper? 
No one could ever say anything bad about me. 
He seems to be walki ng suddenly, with you, 
As though he dealt with a girl of easy virtue’. 
I confess, I didn’t know what  it was, though,     3175 
That I began to feel, and to your advantage too,  
But certainly I was angry with myself, oh, 
That I could not be angrier with you. 
 
Faust 
 
Sweet darling! 
 
Margaret 
 
Wait a moment! 
 
(She picks a Marguerite and pulls the petals off one by one .) 
 
Faust 
   What’s that for, a bouquet? 
 
Margaret 
 
No, it’s a game.  
Faust 
   What? 
 Margaret 
      No, you’ll laugh if I say!    3180 
  
(She pulls off the petals, murmuring to herself .) 
 
Faust 
 
What are you whispering?  
Margaret  (Half aloud .) 
      He loves me – he loves me not. 
 
Faust 
 
You sweet face that Heaven forgot! 
 Margaret  (Continuing .) 
 
Loves me – Not – Loves me – Not 
 
(She plucks the last petal with delight .) 
 He loves me!  
Faust 
 
Yes, my child! Let this flower-speech 
Be heaven’s speech to you. He loves you!     3185 
Do you know what that means? He loves you!  
(He grasps her hands .) 
 
Margaret 
 
I’m trembling! 
 
Faust 
   Don’t tremble, let this look, 
Let this clasping of hands tell you What’s inexpressible:        3190 
To give oneself wholly, and feel 
A joy that must be eternal! 
Eternal! – Its end would bring despair. No, no end! No end! 
 
(Margaret presses his hand, frees he rself, and runs away . He stands a 
moment in thought: then follows her .)  
 
Martha (Coming forward .) 
 Night is falling. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
  Yes, and we must away.     3195 
 
Martha 
 
I’d ask you to remain here longer, 
But this is quite a wicked place. 
It’s as if they had nothing to do yonder, 
And no work they should be doing But watching their neighbours’ to-ing and fro-ing,    3200 And whatever one does, insults are hurled. 
And our couple, now? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
 Flown up the passage, there.  
Wilful little birds! 
 
Martha 
 
   He seems keen on her. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
And she on him. It’s the way of the world. Part I Scene XIII: An Arbour in the Garden 
 
(Margaret comes in, hides behind the door of the garden-house, holds her 
fingers to her lips, and peeps through the gaps .) 
 
Margaret 
 
He’s coming. 
 
Faust  (Appearing .) 
 
Ah, rascal, you tease me so! I’ve got you!   3205 
 
(He kisses her .) 
 
Margaret (Clasping him, and returning the kiss .) 
 Dearest man! With all my heart I love you! 
 
(Mephistopheles knocks .) 
 
Faust  (Stamping his foot in frustration .) 
 Who’s there?  
Mephistopheles 
 
 A dear friend! 
 
Faust 
  A creature! 
 
 
Mephistopheles 
        It’s time to go. Martha  (Appearing .) 
 
Yes, sir, it’s late! 
 
Faust 
  
May I keep company with you, though? 
 
Margaret 
 
My mother would tell me, – Farewell!  
Faust 
          Must I go, then? 
Farewell! 
 
Martha 
 
  Goodbye, now! 
 
Margaret 
 
         And soon to meet again!   3210 
 (Faust and Mephistopheles exit .) 
 
Margaret 
 
Dear God! That one man, by thinking, 
Can know everything, oh, everything! I stand in front of him, ashamed 
And just say yes to all he says. 
I’m such a poor, ignorant child, and he -     3215 I can’t understand what he sees in me. Part I Scene XIV: Forest and Cavern 
 
(Faust, alone .) 
 Sublime spirit, you ga ve me all, all, 
I asked for. Not in vain have you 
Revealed your face to me in flame. You gave me Nature’s r ealm of splendour,     3220 
With the power to feel it, and enjoy. 
Not merely as a cold, awed stranger, 
But allowing me to look deep inside, Like seeing into the heart of a friend. 
You lead the ranks of living creatures      3225 
Before me, showing me my brothers In the silent woods, the air, the water. 
And when the storm roars in the forest, 
When giant firs fell their neighbours, Crushing nearby branches in their fall,      3230 
Filling the hills with hollow thunder, 
You lead me to the safety of a cave, Show me my own self, and reveal 
Your deep, secret wonders in my heart. 
And when the pure Moon, to my eyes,      3235 Rises, calming me, the silvery visions  Of former times, drift all around me, 
From high cliffs, and moist thickets, 
Tempering thought’s austere delight. Oh, I know now that nothing can be      3240 
Perfect for Mankind. You gave me, 
With this joy, that brings me nearer, Nearer to the gods, a companion, 
Whom I can no longer do without, 
Though he is impudent, and chilling, Degrades me in my own eyes, and with     3245 
A word, a breath, makes your gifts nothing. 
He fans a wild fire in my heart, Always alive to that lovely form. So I rush from desire to enjoyment, 
And in enjoyment pine to feel desire.      3250 
  
(Mephistopheles enters .) 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Haven’t you had enough of this life yet? 
How can you be happy all this time? It’s fine for a man to try it for a bit, But then you need a newer clime! 
 
Faust 
 
I wish you’d something else to do,      3255 
Than plague me on a good day.  
Mephistopheles 
 
Now, now! I’d gladly ignore you, 
You don’t really mean it anyway. 
You’d be little loss to me,  A rude, mad, sour companion.       3260 
One’s hands are full all day, and see, 
What pleases you, or what to let be, No one can tell from your expression.  
Faust 
 
So that’s the tone he takes! 
I’m to thank him, for boring me.      3265 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Poor Son of Earth, how could you make 
Your way through life without me? 
I’ve cured you for a while at least 
Of your twitches of imagination, If I weren’t here, you’d certainly      3270 Have walked right off this earthly station. 
In rocky hollows, in a hole, 
Why sit around here, like an owl? From soaking moss and dripping stone, 
Sucking your nourishment, like a toad?     3275 
Spend your time sweeter, better! 
Your body’s still stuck there with the Doctor.  
Faust 
 
Do you understand the new power of being 
That a walk in the wilderness can bring? 
But then, if you were able to guess,      3280 
You’re devil enough to be grudge my happiness. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
An other-worldly pleasure. 
Night and day, mountains for leisure. 
Clasping heaven and earth, blissfully,  Inflating yourself, becoming a deity.      3285 
With expectant urge burrowi ng through earth’s core, 
Feeling all that six days’ work, in yours, To taste who knows what, in power’s pride, 
Overflowing, almost, with the joy of life, 
Vanishing, the Earthly Son,       3290 And into some deep Intuition –  
(With a gesture .) 
 I can’t say how – passing inside.  
 
Faust 
 
Fie, on you! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
   Ah, you don’t like it from me! 
You’ve the right, to say ‘fie’ to me, politely. Before chaste ears men daren’t speak aloud,     3295 
That which chaste hearts can’t do without: 
Short and sweet, I begrud ge the pleasure you get From occasionally lying to yourself, about it. 
But you won’t hold out for long, I’m sure. 
You’re already over-driven,       3300 
Sooner or later you’ll be given To madness, or to fear and horror. 
Enough! Your lover sits inside, 
All is dull, oppressive to her, She can’t get you out of her mind,      3305 Her deep love overwhelms her. 
First your love’s flood round her flowed, 
As a stream pours from melted snow: You’ve so filled her heart, and now, 
Your stream again is shallow.       3310 
Instead of enthroning yourself in the wood, Let the great gentleman do some good, 
To that poor little ape of flesh and blood, 
And reward her, I think, for her love. Her days seem pitifully long:       3315 
She sits at the window, cloud drifting 
Over the old City wall, sees it lifting.  ‘Would I were a little bird!’ runs her song, 
All day long, and all night long. 
Sometimes lively, mostly not,       3320 Sometimes crying out, in tears, Then quiet again, it appears, 
And always in love. 
 
Faust 
 
You snake! You snake, you! 
 
Mephistopheles 
    
A touch! That caught you!       3325 Faust 
 
Wretch! Be gone from my presence: 
Don’t name that lovely girl to me! Don’t bring desire for that sweet body 
Before every half-maddened sense! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Well, what then? She thinks you’ve flown away,    3330 
And, half and half, you already have, I’d say. 
 
Faust 
 
I’m near her, and were I still far, 
I can’t lose her or forget her, 
I even envy the body of our Lord, When her lips touch it at the altar.      3335 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Quite so, my friend! My envy often closes 
On that pair of twins that feed among the roses.  
Faust 
 
Away from me, procurer! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
     Fine, you curse and I must smile. 
The god who made both man and woman, 
He likewise knew the noblest profession,     3340 So made the opportunity as well. 
Go on, it’s a crying shame! 
Since you’re bound, all the same For your lover’s room, not death. Faust 
 
Where is the heavenly joy in her arms?     3345 
Let me warm myself with her charms! Do I not always feel her absent breath? 
Am I not the fugitive? The homeless one? 
The creature without aim or rest, A torrent in the rocks, still thundering down,     3350 Foaming eagerly into the abyss? 
And she beside it, with  vague childlike mind, 
In a hut there, on a little Alpine field, So, her first homely life you’d find,  
Hidden there in that little world.      3355 
And I, the god-forsaken, Was not great enough, 
To grasp the cliffs, and take them, 
And crush them into dust! I still must undermine her peaceful life!     3360 
You, Hell, must have your sacrifice. 
Help, Devil, curtail the anxious moment brewing. 
What must be, let it be, and swiftly! 
Let her fate also fall on me, 
And she and I rush to ruin!        3365 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Again it glows: again it seethes! 
Go in and comfort her, you fool! 
When a brain, like yours, no exit sees, 
It calls it the end of all things, too. Praise him who keeps his courage fresh!     3370 
Or you’ll soon get quite be-devilled, there. 
I find nothing in the world so tasteless, As a Devil, in despair. Part I Scene XV: Gretchen’s Room 
 
(Gretchen alone at the spinning wheel .) 
 ‘My peace is gone, 
My heart is sore:         3375 
I’ll find it, never, Oh, nevermore.  
When he’s not here, 
My grave is near, The world is all,         3380 
A bitter gall. 
 My poor head 
Feels crazed to me. 
My poor brain Seems dazed to me.        3385 
 
My peace is gone, My heart is sore: 
I’ll find it, never, 
Oh, nevermore.  Only to see him         3390 
I look out. 
Only to meet him, I leave the house. 
 
His proud steps, His noble figure,         3395 
His smiling lips, 
His eyes: their power.  
And all his speech 
Like magic is, His fingers’ touch,         3400 And, oh, his kiss! My peace is gone, 
My heart is sore: 
I’ll find it, never, 
Oh, nevermore.         3405  
My heart aches 
To be with him, Oh if I could Cling to him, 
 
And kiss him,         3410 The way I wish, 
So I might die, 
At his kiss!     
Part I Scene XVI: Martha’s Garden 
 
(Margaret. Faust .) 
 
Margaret 
 
Promise me, Heinrich! 
 
Faust 
         If I can! 
 
Margaret 
 
Say, as regards religion, how you feel.      3415 
I know that you are a dear, good man, 
Yet, for you, it seem s, it has no appeal. 
 
Faust 
 
Leave that alone, child! Y ou feel I’m kind to you: 
For Love I’d give my blood, my life too. 
I’ll rob no man of his church and faith.     3420  
Margaret 
 
That’s not right, we must  have faith. 
 
Faust 
 
Must we? 
 
Margaret 
 
            Ah, if in this I was only fluent! 
You don’t respect the Holy Sacrament.  
Faust 
 
I respect it.  
Margaret 
  
    Without wanting it, though. You’ve passed 
So many years without confession, or mass.     3425 
Do you believe in God? 
 
Faust 
 
  My darling, who dare say:  
‘I believe in God’?  Choose priest to ask, or sage, 
The answer would seem a joke, would it not, 
Played on whoever asks?  
Margaret 
   
   So, you don’t believe?     3430 
 
Faust 
 
Sweetest being, don’ t misunderstand me! 
Who dares name the nameless? Or who dares to confess: ‘I believe in him’? 
Yet who, in feeling,        3435 
Self-revealing, Says: ‘I don’t believe’? 
The all-clasping, 
The all-upholding, Does it not clasp, uphold,        3440 
You: me, itself? 
Don’t the heavens arch above us? Doesn’t earth lie here under our feet? 
And don’t the eternal stars, rising, 
Look down on us in friendship?       3445 Are not my eyes re flected in yours? 
And don’t all things press 
On your head and heart, 
And weave, in eternal mystery, Visibly: invisibly, around you?       3450 
Fill your heart from it: it is so vast, 
And when you are blessed by the deepest feeling, 
Call it then what you wish, Joy! Heart! Love! God! 
I have no name         3455 
For it! Feeling is all: Names are sound and smoke,  Veiling Heaven’s bright glow. 
 
Margaret 
 
That’s all well and good, I know, 
The priest says much the same,       3460 Only, in slightly different words. 
 
Faust 
 
It’s what all hearts, say, everywhere 
Under the heavenly day, Each in its own speech: 
And why not I in mine?        3465 
 
Margaret 
 
Listening to you, it almost seems quite fine, 
Yet something still seems wrong, to me, Since you don’t possess Christianity. 
 
Faust 
 
Dear child! 
 
Margaret 
 
 I’ve long been grieved 
To see you in such company.       3470 Faust 
 
 Why, who? 
 
Margaret 
 
That man who hangs round you so, 
I hate him in my innermost soul: Nothing in all my life has ever 
Given my heart such pain, no, never, 
As his repulsive face has done.       3475  
Faust 
 
Don’t be afraid of him, sweet one! 
 
Margaret 
 
His presence here, it chills my blood. 
To every other man I wish good: But much as I’m longing to see you 
I’ve a secret horror of seeing him, too,      3480 
I’ve thought him a rogue, all along! God forgive me, if I do him wrong!  
Faust 
 
There have to be such odd fellows. 
 
Margaret 
 
I’d rather not live with such as those! 
Once he’s inside the door, again,      3485 He looks around in a mocking way, 
And half-severely: 
You can see he’s not at all in sympathy: It’s written on his forehead even, That there’s no spirit of love within.      3490 
I’m so happy in your arms, 
Free, untroubled, and so warm, Yet I’m stifled in his presence.  
 
Faust 
 
You angel, full of presentiments!  
 
Margaret 
 
It oppresses me, so deeply, too,       3495 
That when he meets with us, wherever, 
I feel that I no longer love you. Ah I can’t pray when he’s there, 
And that gnaws inside me: oh, 
Heinrich, for you too, surely it’s so.      3500 
 
Faust 
 
It’s merely an antipathy! 
 
Margaret 
 
I must go now. 
 
Faust 
 
Ah, will there never be 
An hour where I can clasp you to my heart, And heart to heart, and soul, to soul impart? 
 
Margaret 
 
Ah, if I only slept alone!        3505 
For you, I’d gladly draw the bolt tonight: But my mother hears the slightest tone, 
And if we were caught outright, 
I’d die on the selfsame spot! Faust 
 
You angel: no need for that.       3510 
Here is a little phial to keep! Three drops of this, in her drink, she’ll take, 
And Nature will favour her with deepest sleep. 
 
Margaret 
 
What would I not do for your sake? 
I hope that it won’t harm her though!      3515  
Faust 
 
Would I advise it, Love, if it were so? 
 
Margaret 
 
Ah, I only have to see you, dearest man, 
And something bends me to your will, For you, so much, I have already done, 
Little remains for me to do for you still.     3520 
 (She exits .) 
 
(Mephistopheles enters .) 
  The little monkey! Has it gone? 
 
Faust 
 
       Spying again, are you? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I’ve heard in infinite detail, how 
The Doctor works hi s catechism through, 
And I hope it does you good, now. 
Girls are always so keen to review      3525 
Whether one’s virtuous, and sticks to the rules. They think if a man can be  led, he’ll follow too. 
 
Faust 
 
Monster, you can’t see 
How this true loving soul, 
Full of a belief,         3530 That is wholly Her salvation, torments herself so, 
In case her lover should be lost indeed.  
 
Mephistopheles 
 
You sensual wooer, beyond the sensual, 
A Magdalen leads you by the nose, I see.     3535 
 
Faust 
 
Abortion, of the filth and fire of hell! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
And how well she reads one’s physiognomy: 
In my presence, sens es, without knowing how, 
The hidden mind behind the mask: she feels 
That I’m an evil genius, at least, and now     3540 
Perhaps, that it’s the Devil it conceals. So, tonight? – 
 
Faust 
 
     What’s that to you? 
 
Mephistopheles  
 
I take my pleasure in it too!  Part I Scene XVII: At The Fountain  
 
(Gretchen and Lisbeth .) 
 
Lisbeth 
 
Have you not heard from Barbara? 
 
Gretchen  
 
Not a word. I go out so seldom.       3545 
 
Lisbeth 
 
It’s certain, Sibyl to ld me: well then, 
She finally fell to that seducer. 
There’s a lady for you!  
Gretchen 
 
     How so? 
 
Lisbeth 
 
          It stinks! 
She’s feeding two when she eats and drinks. 
 
Gretchen 
 
Oh!           3550  
Lisbeth 
 
Serves her right then, finally. 
She clung to that fellow, oh so tightly! 
That was a fine to-ing and fro-ing, Round the village, and dance-going, Ahead of us all, they had to shine,      3555 
Him treating her always to cakes and wine: 
She the picture of loveliness, oh so fine, So low after all, then, and so shameless, 
And the gifts she took from him, nameless. 
It was all kissing and carrying on:      3560 
But now the flower is gone!  
Gretchen 
 
The poor thing!  
Lisbeth 
 
           Why are you so pitying? 
When each of us was at our spinning, 
When mother never let us out, She and her lover hung about:       3565 
On the bench, in a dark alley, 
Forgetting the time, he and she. She can’t raise her head again, 
In a sinner’s shift now, penitent. 
 
Gretchen 
 
Surely he’ll take her fo r his wife.      3570 
 
Lisbeth 
 
He’d be a fool! A lively fellow 
Can ply his trade elsewhere, and so - 
He’s gone. 
 
Gretchen 
    Oh, that’s not nice! 
 
Lisbeth 
 
If she gets him, she’ll reap ill in a trice, 
The lads will tear at her wr eath, what’s more     3575 
We’ll scatter chaff  in front of her door!  (She exits .) 
 
Gretchen  (Walking home. ) 
 How proudly I’d revile her, then, 
Whenever some poor girl had fallen! 
I couldn’t find words enough, I mean, To pour out scorn for another’s sin!      3580 Black as it seemed, I made it blacker, 
Not black enough for me: oh never. 
It blessed its own being, that proud self, Yet now I’m the image of sin, myself! 
Yet all that drove me on to do it,      3585 
God! Was so fine! Oh, so sweet!  Part I Scene XVIII: A Tower 
 
(In a niche of its wall a shrine, and image of the Mater Dolorosa, with 
flowers in front of it. Gretchen sets out fresh flowers.  ) 
 
Gretchen 
 
Oh bow down, 
Sorrowful one, 
Your kind face, to my affliction! 
 A sword in your heart,        3590 
Where a thousand pains start, 
You look up, at your dead Son.  
You look up to the Father, 
You send Him your sighs, there, For His, and for your, affliction.      3595 
 
Who then can feel, How like steel, 
Is the pain inside my bones? 
What my poor heart fears for, What it quakes for, and longs for      3600 You know, and you alone! 
 
Wherever I go now, How sore, sore, sore now  
How sore my heart must be! 
Ah, when I’m alone here,        3605 I moan, moan, moan here: 
My heart it breaks in me. 
 The pots before my window! 
My tears bedewed them so, 
In the early dawn, when        3610 I picked the flowers below. The sun it shone so brightly, 
And early, in my room, 
Where I sat already, 
On my bed, in deepest gloom.       3615  
Help me! Oh, save me, fro m shame and destruction! 
Oh, bow down, Sorrowful one, Your kind face, to my affliction!  Part I Scene XIX: Night 
 
(The Street in front of Gretchen’s door .) 
 Valentine  (A soldier, Gretchen’s brother .) 
 
When I have sat, and heard the toasts,      3620 Where everyone makes good his boasts, And comrades praised,  to me, the flower 
Of maidenhood, and loud the hour, 
With brimming glass that blurred the praise, And elbows sticking out all ways,      3625 
I sat in my own peace secure, 
Listening to the boastful roar, And as I stroked my beard, I’d smile 
And take a full gl ass in my hand, 
Saying: ‘Each to his own, but I’ll      3630 Ask if there’s any in this land, 
Who, to my Gretel, can compare 
Whose worth can ever equal hers?’ Hear! Hear! Clink! Clang! Went around: 
Some cried out: ‘He’s quite correct,      3635 
She’s an ornament to all her sex.’  There sat the boasters, not a sound. And now! – I could tear my hair out, bawl, 
And dash my head against the wall! – 
With jeers, they now turn up their noses:     3640 Every rogue can taunt me, he supposes! 
Like a bankrupt debtor, when I’m sitting, 
A casual word can start me sweating! 
And though I thrash them all together, 
I’ve still no right to call them liars.      3645 
 Who goes there? What’s creeping by? 
If I’m not wrong, there’s two I spy. 
If it’s him, I’ll have him by the skin, Alive he’ll not leave the place he’s in! (Faust. Mephistopheles ) 
 
Faust 
 
How the glow of the eternal light      3650 
Shines from the Sacr isty window, there, 
On either side grow s fainter, fainter, 
And all around draws in the night!  Now it seems as dark within my heart. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
And I’ve a little of the tom-cat’s art,      3655 
That creeps around the fire escape, Then slinks along the wall, a silent shape, 
I’m quite virtuous in my way, 
A little prone to thieve, and stray. The splendour of Walpurgis Night,      3660 
Already haunts all my members,  
It’s the day after tomorrow’s light: There, why one watches, one remembers. 
 
Faust 
 
Meanwhile you’ll bring that wealth to view,  
That I see there, glimmering, behind you?     3665 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
You’ll soon experience the delight 
Of holding this cauldron to the light. 
I recently had a squint inside – 
Where splendid silver dollars hide.  
Faust 
 
And not a jewel, or a ring,       3670 To adorn my darling girl? 
 Mephistopheles 
 
Among the rest I saw a thing, 
A sort of necklace, made of pearl.  
Faust 
 
That’s good! It’s painful to me, To take no gift for her to see.       3675 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
You shouldn’t find it so annoying, 
To get something now, for nothing. Now the sky glows, filled with stars, 
You’ll hear the work of a master: 
I’ll sing a few moralising bars,       3680 All the better to seduce her. 
 
(Sings to the zither .) 
 
‘Why are you here, 
Katrina dear, In daylight clear, At your lover’s door?        3685 
No, no! Not when, 
It will let in, A maid, and then, 
Let out a maid no more! 
  
Take care: for once        3690 
It’s over and done, And it’s all gone, 
Goodnight to you, poor thing! 
Keep love’s belief, And pleasure brief, From every thief,         3695 
Unless you’ve a wedding ring.’ 
 Valentine  (Approaching .) 
 
Whom do you lure? By every element! 
You evil-tongued rat-catcher! To the devil, with your instrument!      3700 
To the devil, too, with the singer! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
The zither’s broken! There’s nothing left of it. 
 
Valentine 
 
There’s a still a skull left I’ll need to split!  
Mephistopheles  (To Faust .) 
 Look lively, Doctor! Don’t give ground. 
Stand by: I’ll command this thing.      3705 
Out with your fly-whisk, now. You lunge! I’m parrying. 
 
Valentine 
 
Parry, then! 
 
Mephistopheles  
    And why not, indeed? 
 
Valentine 
 
And that! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
   Ah, yes! Valentine 
   
              The devil opposes me! 
What’s this? My hand’s already maimed.     3710  
Mephistopheles (To Faust .) 
 Thrust, home!  
Valentine  (Falls .) 
 
  Ah! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
          Now, the lout is tamed! 
Away, we must go! Swiftly, of course, Soon the cries of murder will begin, 
With the police, now, I’m well in: 
But not so much so with the courts.      3715 
 
(He exits with Faust .) 
 Martha  (At the window .) 
 
Come here! Come here! 
 Gretchen  (At the window .) 
 
          Here’s a light!  
Martha 
 
Hear how they swear and struggle, yell and fight. 
 
On-lookers 
 
Here’s one dead already! Martha (Leaving the house .) 
 
Where have the murderers gone? 
 Gretchen  (Leaving the house .) 
 
Who is it, lying there?  
On-lookers 
 
  Your mother’s son.      3720 
 
Gretchen 
 
Almighty God! What misery! 
 
Valentine 
 
I’m dying! That’s soon spoken, 
And, sooner still, it will be done. Why stand there, crying, woman? 
Come, hear me everyone!       3725 
 (They gather round him .) 
 
You’re still young, my Gretchen, see! 
And still haven’t sense enough, to be Effective in your occupation. 
I’ll tell you confidentially: 
Now that you’re a whore indeed,      3730 Be one, by proclamation! 
 
Gretchen 
 
My brother! God! Why speak to me so? 
 
Valentine 
 
In this business, leave God alone! 
Sadly, what is done is done, And what will come: will come.      3735 
Begin with one, in secret, then, 
Soon you’ll gather other men, 
And, when a dozen of them have had you, All the town can have you too. 
When Shame herself appears,       3740 
She’s first brought secretly to light, Then they draw the veil of night Over both her eyes and ears: 
Men would gladly kill her, I say, 
But they let her walk about  and prosper,     3745 
So she goes nakedly by day, 
Yet isn’t any lovelier. 
She’s the uglier to our sight, The more it is she seeks the light. 
Truly I can see the day        3750 
When all honest people  Will turn aside from you, girl, 
As from a corpse with plague. 
Your heart’s flesh will despair, When they look you in the face,       3755 
You’ll have no golden chain to wear! 
At the altar, there, you’ll have no place! You’ll not be dancing joyfully In all your lovely finery! 
In some wretched gloomy corner, you      3760 
Will hide, with cripples and beggars too, And, though God may still forgive, 
Be damned on earth while you live! 
 
Martha 
 
Commend your soul to God’s mercy! 
Will you end your life with blasphemy?      3765  Valentine 
 
If I could destroy your withered body, 
Shameless, bawd, I’d hope to see A full measure of forgiveness 
For me, and all my sinfulness. 
 
Gretchen 
 
My brother! These are the pains of hell!     3770 
 
Valentine 
 
I said, leave off weeping, girl! 
When you and honour chose to part, 
That was the sword-thrust in my heart. 
I go, through a sleep within the grave, To God, as a soldier, true and brave.      3775

The Evil Spirit 
 
How different it was, Gretchen, 
When you, still innocent, 
Came here to the altar, And from that well-thumbed Book, 
Babbled your prayers,         3780 
Half, a childish game, Half, God in your heart! 
Gretchen! 
What’s in your mind? In your heart,         3785 
What crime? 
Do you pray for your mother’s soul, who Through you, fell asleep to long, long torment? 
Whose blood is on your doorstep? 
And beneath your heart,        3790 Does not something stir and swell, And trouble you, and itself, 
A presence full of foreboding? 
 
Gretchen 
 
Oh! Oh! 
Would I were free of the thoughts      3795 
That rush here and there inside me, 
Despite myself!

The grave trembles! And your heart, From ashen rest, 
To fiery torment         3805 
Brought again, Shudders!

It seems to me as if the organ Steals my breath,         3810

My heart in the abyss.

Mephistopheles 
 
Don’t you just long for a broomstick?      3835 
I wish I’d the sturdiest goat to ride. 
Like this, the journey’s not so quick.  
Faust 
 
So long as my legs  can do the trick, 
This knotted stick will do me fine. 
Why do we need a shorter way! –      3840 To wander this labyrinth of valleys, 
Climb all these cliffs and gullies, 
From which the waters ever spray, That’s a delight enchants the day! 
Spring stirs already in the birches,      3845 
And even the fir tree knows it now: Shouldn’t our limbs feel it search us?  
Mephistopheles 
 
Truly, I don’t feel a thing! 
It’s winter in my body, still, 
On my path I want it frosty, snowing.      3850 How sadly the Moon’s imperfect circle 
With its red belated glow, is rising, 
So dim its light that at every step You scrape a rock, or else a tree! 
Ah, there, a will o’ the wisp leapt!      3855 
It’s burning fiercely, now, I see. Hey! My friend! May I ask your aid? Would you like to give us a blaze? 
Be so good as to light us up the hill! 
 Will O’ The Wisp 
 
With respect, I hope I’ll still be able,      3860 
To keep my Natural light quite stable: We usually zig-zag here, at will. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Ha, ha! He thinks to play the human game. 
Go straight along now, in the Devil’s name! 
Or I’ll blow out your flickering spark!      3865 
 
Will O’ The Wisp 
 
You’re master of the house, I’ll remark, 
And yes, I’ll serve you willingly. 
But think! The mount is magically mad today, And if a will o’ the wisp  should lead the way, 
You mustn’t judge things too precisely.     3870 
 Faust, Mephistopheles, The Will O’ The Wisp  (In alternating song .) 
 
We it seems, now find ourselves. In the sphere of dreams and magic, Do us honour, guide us well  
So our journey will be quick, 
Through the wide, deserted spaces!      3875 Tree on tree now shift their places, 
See how fast they open to us 
And the cliffs bow down before us, And their long and rocky noses, 
How they whistle and blow, for us!      3880 
Through the stones, and through the grasses, Stream and streamlet,  downward, hurrying. 
Is that rustling? Is that singing? 
Do I hear sweet lovers’ sighing, Heavenly days, is that their babbling?      3885 What we hope for, what we love! 
And the echoes, like the murmuring 
Of those other days, are ringing. ‘Too-wit! Too-woo!’ sounding nearer, 
Owl there, and jay, and plover,       3890 
Are they all awake above? 
A salamander in the scrub, he’s Long of leg, and fat of belly! 
And every root like a snake, 
Over sand and rock all bent,       3895 Stretches with a strange intent, To scare us, of us prisoners make: 
From the gnarled and living mass, 
Stretching towards those who pass, Fibrous tentacles. And mice       3900 
Multi-coloured, lemming-wise, 
In the moss and in the heather! And all the fire-flies glowing, 
Crushed together, tightly crowding, 
In their tangled cohorts gather.       3905 Tell me, are we standing still, 
Or are we climbing up the hill? 
All seems spinning like a mill, Rocks and trees, with angry faces 
Lights, now, wandering in spaces,      3910 
Massing: swelling at their will.  
Mephistopheles 
 
Grasp me bravely by the coat-tail! 
Here’s a summit in the middle, 
Where, astonished you can see, 
Mammon glowing furiously.       3915  
Faust 
 
How strangely, through the hollow, glows 
A sort of dull red morning light! 
Into the deepest gorge it flows, Scenting abysses in their night. There vapour rises: here cloud sweeps,     3920 
Here the glow burns through the haze, 
Now like a fragile thread it creeps, Now like a coloured fountain plays. 
Here a vast length winds its way, 
In a hundred veins, down the vales,      3925 
And here in a corner, locked away, All at once, now lonely, fails. 
Nearby the sparks pour down, 
Like showers of golden sand, But see! On all the heights around,      3930 The cliffs, now incandescent, stand. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Has Mammon not lit his palace 
Splendidly, for  this festivity? 
It’s fortunate you’re here to see, 
I already sense the eager guests.       3935  
 
Faust 
 
How the wind roars through the air! 
And whips around my head! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Grasp the ancient stony bed, 
Lest you’re thrown in the abyss, there. 
Mist dims the night to deepest black.      3940 Hear the forest timbers crack! 
The owls are flying off in terror. 
Hear, how the columns shatter, In the vast, evergreen halls. 
Now the boughs groan and fall!       3945 
All the tree-trunks are thrumming! All their roots are creaking, gaping! 
Sinking in a tangled horror, 
Crashing down on each other, And through the ruined gorges       3950 The wind howls and surges. 
Hear the voices on the heights? 
Far away, and then nearby? Yes, a furious magic song 
Sweeps the mountain, a ll along!      3955 
 
Witches  (In chorus .) 
 
To Brocken’s tip the witches stream, 
The stubble’s yellow, the seed is green. There the crowd of us will meet. Lord Urian has the highest seat.

The stinking goat, the farting witch.  
A Voice 
 
Old Baubo comes, alone, and how: 
She’s riding on a mother-sow. 
 
Chorus 
 
So honour then, where honour’s due! 
Baubo, goes first! Then, all the crew!      3965 
A tough old sow, a mother proud, 
Then follow, all the witches’ crowd.  
A voice 
 
Which way did you come?  
A voice 
 
       By the Ilsen Stone! 
I gazed at the owl in her nest alone.  
What a pair of Eyes she made!       3970  
A Voice 
 
O, all you who to Hell’s gate go! 
Why ride there so quickly though? A Voice 
 
She’s driven me hard: oh, see, 
The wounds, all over me!

Like snails in their shells, we’re crawlers, 
All the women are there before us.

We don’t measure with so much care, 
In a thousand steps a Woman’s there. But make whatever speed she can, A single leap, and there is Man.       3985 
 
Voice (From above .) 
 
Come now: come now from stony mere! 
 
Voice (From below. ) 
 
We’d like to climb the heights from here. We’re as bright and clean as ever, 
But we’re unfruitful still, forever.  
Both Choruses 
 
The wind is quiet: a star shoots by,      3990 
The shadowy Moon departs the sky. 
The magic choir’s a rush of sparks, 
Thousands shower through the dark.   Voice  (From below .) 
 
Halt! Halt!  
Voice  (From above .) 
 Who calls there, from the stony vault?      3995 
 
Voice  (From below .) 
 
Take me with you! Take me with you! 
Climbing for three hundred years, I haven’t reached the summit yet, 
I long to be where my peers are met.

Here’s the broom: and here’s the stick,     4000 
The ram is here, the fork to prick. Tonight, whoever can’t deliver 
There’s a man is lost forever. 
 Half-witches (Below .) 
 
I’ve stumbled round so long, down here: How far ahead the rest appear!       4005 
I get no peace around the house, 
And get none either hereabouts. Chorus of Witches 
 
An ointment makes the witches hale: 
A rag will do them for a sail, A trough’s a goodly ship, and tight:      4010 
He’ll fly not who flies not tonight. 
 
Both Choruses 
 
And once we’ve soared around, 
So, alight then, on the ground, Cover the heather, far and wide, 
With your swarming witches’ tide.        4015 
 (They let themselves fall .) 
 
Mephistopheles  
They push and shove, they roar and clatter! 
They whistle and whirl, jostle and chatter! They glimmer and sparkle, stink and flare! 
The genuine witch-element’s there! 
We’ll soon be parted, so stay near!      4020 Where are you?  
Faust (In the distance .) 
    H e r e !    
Mephistopheles 
 
         What! Nearly out of sight? 
Then I’ll have to use a master’s right. 
Ground! Sir Voland comes. Sweet folk, give ground! Here, Doctor, hold tight! In a single bound, 
Far from the crowd, we’ll soon be free:     4025 
It’s too much, even for the likes of me. 
Something burned there with a special light, In that thicket, as far then as I could see, 
Come on! We can slip inside, all right. 
 Faust 
 
You spirit of contradiction! Go on! I follow you.    4030 
I think after all it’s worked out quite cleverly: We walk the Brocken on Wa lpurgis Night, yet we 
Are as isolated now, as we ever could choose. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
See now, what colours flare! 
A lively mob club together there.      4035 In little groups one’s not alone. 
 
Faust 
 
I’d still rather be higher, though! 
I can see fire and whirling smoke. There the crowd stream, to the Evil One: 
There many a puzzle finds solution.      4040 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
But many a puzzle’s knotted so. 
Let the whole world have its riot, Here we’ll house ourselves in quiet. 
It’s a long and well-established tradition, 
From the great one makes a smaller edition.     4045 
I see young witches,  naked, bare, 
And old ones, veiled cunningly.  
For my sake, be a little friendly. The trouble’s slight, the fun is rare. 
I hear instruments being tuned, too!      4050 
A cursed din, you’ll soon get used to. Come, with me! There’s no way otherwise, 
I’ll step ahead, lead you to their eyes, 
And earn your fresh gratitude, so. What say you? There’s lots of room, my friend.    4055 Look over there! You can’t see its end. 
A hundred fires burning, in a row, 
They love, and drink, and dance, and chat, Tell me where you’ll find better than that?  
 
Faust 
 
Will you, as we make our bow,       4060 
Play the devil, or wizard now? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
To be sure I’m used to travelling incognito, 
But on formal occasions rank’s allowed to show. I’ve no Knight’s garter to mark me out, 
But the cloven foot’s honoured in this house.     4065 
Do you see how that sna il there crawls to me: 
With those delicate feelers on its head, 
It’s already scented me, you see, 
I can’t deny myself, if I wished. Come! We’ll go from fire to fire,      4070 
I’m the broker: you’re the suitor. 
 (To some, sitting by dying embers .) 
 
Old sirs, what do you sit at the edge for? I’d praise you, in the middle, more, Among the youthful buzz, and shout. 
You’re alone enough inside the house.      4075 
 
The General 
 
Who would trust the Nation! 
One’s toiled so long for it: 
With the people, as with women, 
Youth’s always the best fit.  
The Minister 
 
From every rule they’ve gone astray,      4080 
Me, I praise the good old days, 
Then, truly, we were all the rage, 
That was a real golden age.   
The Nouveau Riche 
 
We weren’t so stup id, you’d have found, 
And often did, what wasn’t right:      4085 
But now it all turns round and round, 
Just as we’d like to grasp it tight.  
Author 
 
Who writes anything good these days, 
Or reads with moderate intelligence! 
And what the dear young folk all praise,     4090 
I’ve never seen such stupid nonsense.   
Mephistopheles  (Suddenly looking old .) 
 I feel folk are ripe for Judgement Day, 
Of Witches’ Mount, I’ve made my last ascent. 
And now my cask runs cloudy, anyway, The world itself is all as good as spent.     4095 
 
Witch-Marketeer 
 
Gentlemen: don’t pass me by! 
Don’t lose the opportunity! 
Inspect my wares attentively, I’ve a selection for your eye. 
There’s nothing on my stall, here,      4100 
On Earth, it’s equal you’ll not find, That hasn’t caused some harm somewhere,  
To the world itself, and then, mankind. 
No knife that isn’t dyed in gore, No cup that, through some healthy body,     4105 
Hot, gnawing venom hasn’t poured, 
No gems that haven’t bought some kindly Girl, no sword that’s not cut ties that bind, Or, perhaps, struck an enemy from behind. Mephistopheles 
 
Granny! You misunderstand the age.      4110 
What’s gone: is done! What’s done: is gone!  Get novelties they’re all the rage! 
Now it’s novelties that lead us on. 
 
Faust 
 
Don’t let me lose myself in here! 
Now, this is what I call a fair!       4115  
Mephistopheles 
 
This whole whirlpool’s trying to climb above, 
You think you’re shoving, and you’re being shoved! 
 
Faust 
 
Who is that, there? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
  Note that madam! 
That’s Lilith. 
 
Faust 
  Who? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
         First wife to Adam. 
Pay attention to her lovely hair,       4120 The only adornment she need wear. 
When she traps a young man in her snare, 
She won’t soon let him from her care.  
Faust 
 
Those two, the old and young one, sitting, 
They’ve leapt about more than is fitting!     4125 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
No rest tonight for anyone. 
Let’s grasp them. There’s a new dance, come! 
 Faust (Dancing with the lovely young witch .) 
 
A lovely dream once came to me, And there I saw an apple-tree, 
Two lovely apples, there, did shine,      4130 
Tempting me so, I had to climb.  
The Young Witch 
 
Apples you love a lot, I know, 
That once in Paradise did grow. 
I’m deeply moved with joy to feel, That such my garden does reveal.      4135  
Mephistopheles  (Dancing with the old witch .) 
 A vile dream once came to me, 
In it, I saw an old cleft tree, 
A monstrous crack th ere met my eyes, 
It pleased me, though, despite its size. 
 
The Old Witch 
 
I offer my best greetings to       4140 
The knight of the cloven shoe! He’ll need to have a real stopper, If he’s not scared of that whopper. 
 
 A Rationalist  (Nicolai ) 
 
Cursed Folk! How do you dare to? 
Haven’t we shown, for many a season,     4145 
Spirits can’t exist: it stands to reason? 
Yet you dance around, just as we do! 
 The Lovely Witch  (Dancing .) 
 
Why’s he here then, at our ball? 
 Faust  (Dancing .) 
 
Oh! He’s everywhere , and into all. 
While others dance, he must reflect.      4150 
If he can’t discuss every last step, 
It’s as good as if it didn’t happen. He’s angriest at a forward pattern. 
But if you turn around in circles, 
As he does in his ancient mills,       4155 He’ll call it excellent, least ways 
If you greet with interest what he says. 
 
The Rationalist 
 
You’re still there! Oh, it’s quite unheard of. 
We’re enlightened now, so take yourselves off! The Devil’s crew’s discounted  by every rule:    4160 
Yet though clever, still we’re haunted, in Tegel, too. 
 
The Young Witch 
 
Well listen: here we’re bored with it! 
 
The Rationalist 
 
I tell you, Spirit, to your face:       4165 For me, spirit-rule has no place: 
Because my spirit can’t exercise it. 
 (The dance continues .) 
 
I see, tonight, I’ll have no success: 
But I get a bit from every trip, And hope, before the final step,       4170 
I’ll defeat the devils and the poets. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Now he’ll sit in some wet sump, 
And console himself, like that, about you, And if he sticks leeches on his rump, 
He’s cured of the Spirit, and Spirits, too.     4175 
 (To Faust, who has left the dance .) 
 
Why have you deserted that lovely girl, Who sang so sweetly in the dancing? 
 
Faust  
Ugh! Right in the middle of her singing 
A red mouse sprang out of her mouth.  
Mephistopheles 
 
That’s fine: don’t brood on it, anyway:     4180 Enough, that the mouse wasn’t grey. 
At harvest time who queries a mouse?  
 
Faust 
 
Then I saw – 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
   What?  Faust 
 
      Mephisto, can you see 
That lovely child, far off, alone there,      4185 Travelling slowly, so painfully, 
As if her feet were chained together. 
I must admit, without question She’s the image of my sweet Gretchen.  
Mephistopheles 
 
Forget all that! It benefits no one. 
It’s a lifeless magic form, a phantom.      4190 
Encountering it will do you no good: Its fixed stare freezes human blood, 
And then one’s almost turned to stone: 
Medusa’s story is surely known.  
Faust 
 
Those are the eyes of the dead, truly,      4195 
No loving hand has closed their void. 
That’s the breast Gret chen offered to me: 
That’s the sweet body I enjoyed.  
Mephistopheles 
 
It’s magic, fool: you’re  an easy one to move! 
She comes to all, as if sh e were their love.     4200 
 
Faust 
 
What delight! What pain! 
I can’t turn from her, again. 
Strange, around her lovely throat, 
A single scarlet cord adorns her, Like a knife-cut, and no wider!       4205 Mephistopheles 
 
That’s right! I see it too: and note, 
She can carry her head under her arm, Since Perseus did her that fatal harm. 
Always desire for that illusion! 
Come on, climb this bit of mountain:      4210 It’s as lively as the Vienna Prater, And if no one’s deceiving me, 
I’m looking at a genuine theatre. 
You’re showing?  
Servibilis 
 
        It’ll be on again shortly. 
A fresh performance: last of seven.      4215 
That number, for us, is traditional. An amateur’s written it, and then 
It’s amateurs who perform it all. 
Forgive me, sir, if I break off here, Since I’m the amateur curtain-raiser.       4220

  Oberon and Titania’s Golden Wedding. 
 
  An Interlude (Intermezzo)  Theatre Manager 
 
You brave stagehands, of Weimar,  
Take a rest, at least for today. 
Ancient mountains, misty vales are,      4225 
All the scenery for our play.  
Herald 
 
Fifty years we’ve passed by, 
To make this wedding golden, 
But let some argument arise: There’s gold in it, for me, then.       4230 
 
Oberon 
 
Spirits, where I am, be seen: 
Appear, all, at this moment: 
Fairy King, and Fairy Queen, Renew their old intent. 
 
Puck 
 
Puck comes shooting through the air,      4235 
And moves his feet, in time: After him a hundred, there, 
Share his joyful rhyme.  
Ariel 
 
Ariel conducts his singing 
In pure and heavenly tones:        4240 
Ugly faces greet its ringing, 
But also lovely ones.   
Oberon 
 
Partners if you’d get along, 
Learn then from the two of us! 
If we in pairs would love for long,      4245 
Someone needs to separate us.  
Titania 
 
The sulky man, the wilful wife, 
So they might know each other, 
I’d show him all the Northern ice, And show her the Equator.       4250 
 
The Whole Orchestra  (Tutti . Very loud .) 
 From fly-snout and midge-nose, 
And all of their relations, 
Frog and cricket, too, there flow These musical vibrations! 
 
Solo 
 
See, the bagpipes on their way!       4255 
Made from a soap-bubble. Hear the snail’s-twaddle play 
Through its stumpy nozzle.

Spider’s-feet and toad’s-belly, With useless winglets to ’em! 
A little creature, it can’t be 
But it makes a little poem.

Little steps and high leaps, Through honeydew and fragrance here, 
You still won’t do enough it seems,      4265 
To climb into the atmosphere.  
A Curious Traveller 
 
A masquerade of mockery? 
Do I dare to trust my eyes? 
Oberon, that fair divinity, Do I see him here, tonight?       4270 
 
The Orthodox 
 
He’s no tail, and not a claw! 
And yet it’s him, it’s true: 
Like the gods of Greece, I’m sure, He must be a devil too. 
 
Northern Artist 
 
What I capture here today,       4275 
In truth is only sketchy: Yet I prepare myself, someday 
For my Italian journey. Purist 
 
Ah! My bad luck brings me here: 
Since I haven’t been invited!       4280 Of all the witches to appear, 
Only two are powdered. 
 
Young Witch 
 
Powder like a petticoat 
On an old, grey witch you’ll see,  While I sit naked on my goat,       4285 
And show a fine young body.  
 
Married Woman 
 
We have too much experience, 
To moan about you, here, then! 
Yet, as young and tender you are, once, 
So, I hope you will be, rotten.       4290  
Orchestral Conductor 
 
Fly-snout and midge-nose, 
Don’t swarm around the naked! 
Frog and cricket, too, all know 
Your time, and don’t mistake it!  
A Wind-Vane  (Swinging to one side .) 
 Society, as one would like it done:      4295 
True pure brides along the slope! 
And young fellows, one for one, People quite brimful of hope!  
The Wind-Vane  (Swinging to the other side .) 
 
And if the ground doesn’t split, And swallow everyone,        4300 
I’ll be so amazed at it, 
I’ll leap into hell at once.  Xenies  (Barbed verses: Greek – gifts exchanged. ) 
 
As insects we appear, With little claws we’re nipping, 
To do Satan, our Papa,        4305 
Due honour as is fitting.  
Hennings  (August Von Hennings, a literary enemy .) 
 See them, packed in a crowd, 
Naïve, together, poking fun! 
At last, they’ll even say, aloud, Their hearts were blameless ones.      4310 
 
Musagete (Controller of the Muses: Greek – epithet of Apollo ) 
 Among this witches’ crew, 
I’d gladly lose my way: 
They’re easier to manage, too Than Muses, any day.  
 
Former ‘Genius of the Age’ 
 
One was someone, among real folk.      4315 
Come on, then: I can hold my end up!     Like Germany’s Parnassus, look, 
The Blocks berg’s summit’s broad enough. Curious Traveller (Nicolai ) 
 
Say, who’s that haughty man? 
He walks with such proud steps.      4320 He sniffs as only a sniffer-out can. 
‘He smells out Jesuits.’ 
 A Crane  (Lavater ) 
 
I like to fish among the clear 
And the muddy levels: So the pious man appears        4325 
Mixing with the devils. 
    
A Child of This World (Goethe himself .) 
 
To the pious man, as I’m aware, Every place is fitting, 
So you build, on the Blocksberg here, 
Many a house of meeting.       4330  
A Dancer 
 
Does some new choir succeed? 
I hear a distant drum. 
‘No! It’s the booming in the reeds, 
Of bitterns, in unison.’  
A Dancing Master 
 
How they lift their legs, this lot!      4335 
As best they can, they all take flight! 
The cripples skip, the clumsy hop, And don’t care at all what they look like. A Fiddle-Player 
 
The ragged mob all hate so much, 
They’d gladly crush the others.       4340 Here the bagpipe draws them, just  
As Orpheus’ lyre the creatures. 
 
The Dogmatist 
 
I won’t declare it’s madness, now, 
Or show myself too critical. The devil must exist somehow,       4345 
Or how could we act the devil? 
 
The Idealist 
 
The fantasy in my mind, 
For once, is too despotic. 
Truly, if I am all, I find 
Today I’m idiotic!         4350  
The Realist 
 
Here’s real pain, at hand, 
It annoys me so to see it: 
For the first time, here I stand, 
Unsteady, on my feet.  
A Believer in the Supernatural 
 
It’s very pleasant to be here,       4355 
And this crowd too has merit: 
Since from the devil I infer Some much more virtuous spirit.  
A Sceptic 
 
These little flames a-hunting go, 
And think they’re near the treasure:      4360 
But Devil rhymes with doubtful: so 
My being here’s a pleasure.  
Orchestral Conductor 
 
Frog on leaf, and cricket, oh  
You amateur editions! 
Fly-snout and midge-nose,       4365 
Remember you’re musicians!  
The Skilful 
 
Carefree, is what they call 
This band of happy creatures: 
When we can’t go on foot at all Our head it is that features .        4370 
 
The Maladroit 
 
We picked up many a titbit once, 
But now, God orders things so, 
Our shoes are ragged from the dance, And we travel on naked soles. 
 
Will-O’-The-Wisps 
 
From the swamps we’ve come,       4375 
Where we first arose: In the ranks here, we, at once, 
As glittering gallants pose. A Shooting Star 
 
I shoot here from the sky 
And star- and firelight meet.       4380 Now across the grass I lie - 
Who’ll help me to my feet? 
 
The Heavy-Footed  
Room, round about us, room! 
We crush the grasses under. Spirits come, and spirits too       4385 
Have their bulky members.

(A Field. Faust, Mephistopheles .) 
 
Faust 
 
In misery! Despair! Wandering wretchedly  on the face of the earth, for ages, 
and now imprisoned! That kind, unfortuna te creature, locked up in prison as 
a criminal, and lost in torment! To  this! This! – Treacherous, worthless 
spirit, you hid it from me! – Stand there,  then! Roll the devil’s eyes in your 
head, in anger! Stand there, and defy  me with your unbearable presence! 
Imprisoned! In irredeemable misery! Delivered up to evil spirits, and the 
judgement of unfeeling men! And you ’ve troubled me meanwhile with 
tasteless diversions, conc ealed her growing misery  from me, and left her 
helpless in the face of ruin! 
 
Mephistopheles  
 
She is not the first. 
 
Faust 
 
Dog! Loathsome Monster! – Change him,  infinite Spirit! Change the worm 
into his dog-form, in which he often liked to scamper in front of me, at 
night, rolling at the feet of the unsusp ecting traveller, and clambering on his 
shoulders when he fell. Change him in to his favourite likeness, so he can 
crawl on his belly in the sand in front of me, and I can trample him, depraved thing, under my feet! – ‘Not  the first!’ – Misery! Misery! That no 
human spirit can grasp. That more than  one being should sink into the depth 
of this wretchedness: that the first,  writhing in its death-pangs, under the 
eyes of Eternal Forgiveness, did not expiate the guilt of all the others! It 
pierces to the marrow of my bones, th e misery of this one being – and you 
smile calmly at the fate of thousands!  
Mephistopheles 
 
Now we’re out of our wits again, alre ady, at the point where men’s brains 
are cracked. Why did you enter into partnership with us, if you can’t go 
through with it? Would you  take wing, and yet be free of dizziness? Did we 
thrust ourselves on you, or you on us?  
Faust 
 
Don’t gnash your greedy jaws at me! It  disgusts me! – Great and glorious 
Spirit, you who revealed yourself to  me, nobly, who know my heart and 
soul, why shackle me to this disgr aceful companion, who feeds on injury, 
and at the last on ruin?  
Mephistopheles 
 
Have you finished? 
 
Faust 
 
Save her, or woe to you! May the we ightiest curse fall on you for a thousand 
ages! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I can’t undo the bonds of the Avenger, nor loose his bolts. – ‘Save her!’ – 
Who was it dragged her to ruin? I or you? 
 
(Faust looks around, wildly .) 
 Would you grasp the lightning? A good thing it has not been allowed you 
miserable mortals! To crush the innocen t one who replies is the tyrant’s way 
to free oneself of an embarrassment.  
Faust 
 
Take me to her! She shall be freed! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
And the danger you expose yourself to? Be aware, the guilty blood from 
your hands lies on the town. Avenging spir its hover over the place of death, 
and lie in wait for th e murderer’s return. Faust 
 
And not from yours, too? Murder, and death in this world, be on you, 
monster! Take me there,  I say, and free her. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I’ll take you: listen to what I can do!  Have I all the powers of heaven and 
earth? I’ll confuse the jailor’s mind: you take possession of the key, and 
bring her out, hand in human hand! I’ll keep watch: magic horses are ready: 
I’ll carry you away. That, I can do.

Away! Away! Part I Scene XXV: A Dungeon 
 
(Faust, with a bunch of keys and a lamp, in front of an iron door .) 
 A long-forgotten shudder grips me,      4405 
I’m gripped by all of Mankind’s misery, 
Here behind these damp walls, she Lives: and all her guilt’s illusory. Do I tremble, then, to free her! 
Do I dread, once more, to see her!      4410 
On! Fear adds to death’s proximity.  
(He grips the lock. She sings within .) 
 My mother, the whore 
She killed me! 
My father, the rogue, He gnawed me!          4415 
Little sister alone 
Laid out the bone In the cool of the clay: 
Then I was a sweet bird on the stone. 
Fly away! Fly away!        4420  Faust (Unlocking the door .)

Hush! Hush! It’s I who come, to free you. Margaret (Throwing herself down in front of him .) 
 
Are you a man? Then pity my distress.     4425 
 
Faust 
 
Your cries will wake the jailors, too ! 
 
(He grasps the chains, to loose them .) 
 
Margaret  (On her knees .) 
 
Who gives the executioner 
Such power over me! At midnight you’re already here. 
Let me live, have mercy on me!       4430 
Won’t it be soon enough when dawn should come?  
(She stands up .) 
 I’m still so young, so young! 
And yet I’ll die! 
I was lovely too, that was my Ruin. My love was near, now he’s gone:     4435 The garland’s torn: the flowers are done. 
Don’t grip me, now, so violently! 
What harm have I done you? Spare me! Don’t let me beg fo r mercy, in vain, 
I’ve never seen you before today!      4440 
 
Faust 
 
How shall I endure this misery, say!  
Margaret 
 
I’m wholly in your power. Oh, Let me feed my baby first. 
I caressed it all night, though, 
They told me I caused it hurt,       4445 And now they say I killed it, so, 
And now I’ll never be happy again. 
They sing songs of me! It’s wicked of folk! 
There’s an old story ends this way, Who told them to tell it so?       4450 
 
Faust (Falling on his knees .) 
 A lover lies at your feet, 
Who’ll end your painful slavery. 
 Margaret (Throwing herself down next to him .) 
 
O let’s kneel, the saints will bless! 
See here! Under these steps, 
Under this sill,         4455 
Seethes Hell! The Evil One 
With fierce anger, 
Makes his groan!  
Faust  (Aloud ) 
 Gretchen! Gretchen!        4460  
Margaret  (Listening closely .) 
 The voice of my lover! 
 
(She leaps to her feet: the chains fall away .) 
 
Where? I heard him call me. 
I’m free! No one holds me. To his neck, I shall fly, 
On his breast, I shall lie!        4465 
He called Gretchen! Stood at the sill. Among the howls and cries of Hell, Among the devil’s, scornful groans, 
I knew his sweet, dear tones. 
 Faust 
 
I’m here! 
 
Margaret 
 
   Here! O, say it once again!    4470 
 (She embraces him .) 
 
It’s he! It’s he! Where now is all the pain? Where now the chains, the dungeon’s misery? 
You’re here! You co me to save me. 
I am saved! Already the street is there again,      4475 
Where I first saw you plain, 
And the joyful garden, Where Martha and I waited, then. 
 
Faust (Struggling to move .) 
 
Come with me! Come!  
 Margaret (Caressing him .)  
 
    O stay, 
I’ll gladly stay, if you are with me.      4480  
Faust 
 
Away! 
If you don’t hurry, 
We’ll pay for this.  
Margaret 
 
What? You can no longer kiss? 
My dear, so short a time to miss me,      4485 
And you’ve forgotten how to kiss me? 
Why am I so anxious on your breast? When, once, at your words, your gaze, 
With a whole heaven I was blessed, 
And you kissed me, enough to suffocate.     4490 
Kiss me! I kiss you: see!  
 
(She embraces him .) 
 Oh! How cold and silent, 
Your lips. 
Where has your passion        4495 Gone? 
Who brought me this? 
 (She turns away from him .) 
 
Faust 
 
Come! Follow me! Darling, be bold! 
I’ll clasp you with a thousand-fold Warmth: now follow me! I beg you!      4500 
 
Margaret  (Turning to him .) 
 And is it you? Is it really you? 
 
Faust 
 
It is! Come, with me! 
 
Margaret 
 
        You’ll loose the chains, 
And take me to your breast, again. 
How is it you don’t shrink from me? 
Do you know, friend, whom  you free?      4505 Faust 
 
Come! Come! The night  will soon be over.

I’ve killed my mother, I’ve drowned my child. Was it not given to you and I? 
You too. - You here! I s carce believe.      4510 
Give me your hand! This is no dream. Your dear hand! – Ah, but it’s damp! 
Wipe it clean! Why do I think, 
It has blood on. Ah God! What have you done?       4515 
Put your sword away, 
I beg you, please!  
Faust 
 
Let past be past I say! 
You’re destroying me! 
 
Margaret 
 
No you must live on: must do.       4520 
I’ll describe our graves to you. You must begin them 
This very dawn: 
The best one is for my mother, Then, by her, my brother,        4525 
Myself, a little further, lay, 
But not too far away! And the little one, at my right breast. 
No one else by me will lie! – 
Ah, to nestle at your side,        4530 That was a sweet, a darling bliss! But no more will I achieve it: 
It’s as if I must force you to it, 
As if you turn aside my kiss: And yet it’s you, so good, so sweet to see!     4535 
 
Faust 
 
You know it is, so come with me! 
 
Margaret 
 
Out there? 
 
Faust 
 
To Freedom. 
 
Margaret 
 
If the grave is there, 
Death waiting, then I come! 
From here to everlasting rest,       4540 
And not a step further would You go now? O Heinrich, if I could! 
 
Faust 
 
You can! Just will it! The door is open! 
 
Margaret 
 
I dare not: there’s no hope for me then . 
What use is flight? They lie in wait for me.     4545 To be forced to beg is a bitter existence, 
And cursed too with an evil conscience! 
To wander among strangers, bitter, And even then I’d still be captured! 
 
Faust  
I’ll stay beside you.        4550 Margaret 
 
Quickly! Quickly! 
Save my poor baby! Away! Down the ridge, 
Now, by the brook, 
Over the bridge,         4555 Into the wood, Left, where the plank is, 
There, in the pool. 
Seize it now: you! It’s trying to rise,         4560 
It’s moving still! 
Save it! Save it!  
Faust 
 
Be sensible! 
Only one step, and then you’re free! 
 
Margaret 
 
If we were on the mountain, only!      4565 
There my mother sits, on a stone, And oh, the cold, it grips me! 
There my mother sits on a stone, 
And wags her head, so heavy. No sign, no nod, for me, I’m sure      4570 
Her sleep’s so long: she’ll wake no more. 
She slept, while we took our pleasure. That was such a time to treasure! 
 
Faust 
 
Here all’s useless, speech or prayer: 
I’ll take you from this place: I’ll dare.      4575  
Margaret 
 
Let me alone! No, no force! Don’t grip me so murderously, oh, 
I’ve done all else to please you so. 
 
Faust 
 
The day breaks! Dearest! Dearest! 
 
Margaret 
 
Day! Yes, it’s dawn! The last I’ll see:      4580 
My wedding day, that was to be! Tell no one you’ve been with Gr etchen. Ah, bright glance! 
It’s done with: all in vain! 
We two will meet again:        4585 But not in the dance. 
The crowd gather, without speech. 
The streets, the square, Can’t hold them, there. 
The bell tolls, the wand breaks.       4590 
Now, they seize and tie me! I’m dragged already to the block. 
The blade that quivers over me, 
Has quivered before over every neck. Silent the world, now, as the grave!      4595  
Faust 
 
Oh, would that I’d never seen the light! 
 
Mephistopheles (Appears outside .) 
 
Away! Or you’ll be lost, tonight. 
Useless staying and praying! Chattering! The horses are shivering, 
The dawn breaks, clear.        4600  
Margaret 
 
What rises in the doorway, here? Him! Him! Send him away! 
Why is he here in this holy place? 
He wants me!  
Faust 
 
        You will live!  
 
Margaret 
 
God of Judgement! To you, myself I give!     4605 
 
Mephistopheles (To Faust)  
 
Come! Now! Or I leave you both to stew. 
 
Margaret 
 
Father, save me! I belong to you! 
Angels! In Holy Company, Draw round me: guard me! 
Heinrich! For you, I fear.        4610 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
She is judged!  
A Voice  (From above .) 
    She is saved! 
 
Mephistopheles (To Faust .) 
      T o  m e ,  h e r e !  
 
(He vanishes, with Faust .)  
A Voice  (From within, dying away .) 
 
Heinrich! Heinrich!  Part II Act I Scene I: A Pleasant Landscape 
 
(Faust is lying on flowery turf, tired and re stless, trying to sleep. A circle of 
tiny, graceful spirits hovers round him .) 
 
Ariel  (Chanting, accompanied by Aeolian Harps .) 
 When the springtime blossoms, falling, Shower down, and cover all things, 
When the fields with greener blessing      4615 
Dazzle all the world of earthlings, Little elves, but great in spirit, 
Haste to help, where help they can, 
And, be he holy, be he wicked, Pity they the luckless man.       4620 
 
You, hovering in airy circles, round his head  Show yourselves in proud elf-form, instead, 
Calm all the fierce resistance of his heart, 
Remove the bitter barbs of sharp remorse, Free him from past terrors, by your art.     4625 
Four  are the watches night makes in its course, 
At once, now, mercifully, let the dark depart. Let his head sink down on pillow’s coolness, Next sprinkle him with dew from Lethe’s stream: 
Then let his joints be free of cramps and stiffness,    4630 
So that he’s strong enough to greet day’s gleam: Elves exert your sweetest right, 
Return him to the holy light! 
 Choir (Singly, and two or more, alternately and together .) 
 
When the balmy breezes smother  All the green-encircled land,       4635 
Sweetly fragrant a nd mist-covered, 
Twilight gathers all around.  Sweet peace then whispers softly, Rocks the heart on childhood’s shores, 
And on the eyelids, tired and weary, 
Closes daylight’s golden doors.  
Here the night’s already passing, 
Sacred stars set, star by star, 
Great lights, and the lesser glittering, Sparkling near, and gleaming far:      4645 
Sparkling, where the lake reflects her, 
Gleaming bright in cloudless height, Protecting the deep bliss of rest, there, Moon, in splendour, rules the night. 
 
The hours have vanished now, already      4650 Joy and pain have flown away, 
You are whole! Recover, wholly: 
Trust the sight of breaking day. Greening valleys, swelling hills there, 
Rise from out their shadowy sleep:      4655 
And, drifting in its waves of silver, On to harvest, flows the wheat. 
 
Wish then, to achieve your wishes, Gaze up, at the brightness there! 
You are lightly tangled: this is       4660 
Sleep, a shell, so now emerge! Don’t delay, walk bravely, tall, When the crowd waits, hesitating: 
The noblest man achieves his all, 
By seeing, and then, swiftly, taking.      4665  
 
Ariel 
 
Listen! Hear the hour nearing! 
Ringing out to spirit-hearing, Now, the new day is appearing. 
Doors of stone creak and chatter, 
Phoebus’ wheels roll and clatter,      4670 What a din the daylight’s bringing! Trombone- and trumpeting, 
Eyes amazed, and ears ringing, 
The Unheard drops out of hearing. Slip into the flowers presence,       4675 
Deeper, deeper, lie there silent, 
In the pebbles, where the leaves bend: 
If it strikes you, you’ll be deafened.  
Faust 
 
Life’s pulses beating no w, with new existence, 
Greet the mild ethereal half-light round me:     4680 
You, Earth, stood firm tonight, as well: I sense 
Your breath is quickening all the things about me, Already, with that joy you give, beginning 
To stir the strengthening resolution in me, 
That strives, forever, towa rds highest Being. –    4685 
Now the world unfolds, in half-light’s gleam, 
The wood’s alive, its t housand harmonies singing, 
While through the valleys, misted ribbons stream: 
And heavenly light now penetrates the deep: 
Twigs, branches shoot, with fresher life it seems,    4690 
From fragrant gulfs, where they were sunk in sleep: Colour on colour lifts now from the ground, 
As leaf and flower with trembling dewdrops weep – 
And a paradise reveals itself, all round.  Gaze upwards! – The vast mountain heights     4695 Already with the solemn hour resound: 
They are the first to enjoy the eternal light 
That later, for us, will work its way below. Now, to the sloping Alpine meadows bright, 
It gives a fresh clarity, a newer glow,      4700 
And step by step it reaches us down here: – It blazes out! – Ah, already blinded, though 
I turn away, my eyesight wounded, pierced. 
So it is, when to the thing we yearn for The highest wish so intimately rehearsed,     4705 
We find fulfilment opening wide the door: 
And then, from eternal space, there breaks 
A flood of flame, we stand amazed before: We wished to set the torch of life ablaze, 
A sea of fire consumes us, and such fire!     4710 
Love, is it, then? Or ha te? This fierce embrace, The joy and pain of alternating pyres, 
So that, gazing back to earth again, 
We seek to veil ourselves in youth’s desire. 
Let the sun shine on, behind me, then!      4715 The waterfall that splits the cliffs’ broad edge, 
I gaze at with a gr owing pleasure, when 
A thousand torrents plunge  from ledge to ledge, 
And still a thousand more pour down that stair, Spraying the bright foam skywards from their beds.   4720 
And in lone splendour, through the tumult there, 
The rainbow’s arch of colour, bending brightly, Is clearly marked, and th en dissolved in air, 
Around it the cool showers, falling lightly. 
There the efforts of mankind they mirror.     4725 Reflect on it, you’ll understand precisely: 
We live our life amongst refracted colour. Part II Act I Scene II: The Emp eror’s Castle: The Throne Room 
 
(A council of state waits fo r the Emperor. Trumpets .) 
 (Enter court attendants of all kinds, splendidly dressed. The Emperor 
approaches the throne: the Astrologer is to his right .) 
 
The Emperor 
 
I greet you all, the loved, and true, 
Gathered here fro m far and wide: - 
I see a wise man’s at my side,       4730 
But where on earth’s the fool? 
 
Attendant 
 
Right behind your mantle there, He suddenly tumbled on the stair, 
They dragged away the pile of fat. 
Dead: or drunk? No man knows that.      4735  
A Second Attendant 
 
At once, and at a wondrous pace, Another came to take his place. 
Quite extravagantly dressed, 
Yet troubling, since he’s so grotesque: Guards closed the door in his face,      4740 
Their halberds held crosswise too – 
Yet here he comes, the daring fool!  
Mephistopheles  (Kneeling in front of the throne .) 
 What is cursed, and yet is welcomed? 
What’s desired, yet chased away? 
What’s always carefully defended?      4745 What’s abused: condemned, I say? What do you not dare appeal to? 
What will all, happily, hear named? 
What stands on the step before you? What’s banished from here, all the same?     4750 
 
The Emperor 
 
For once, at least, spare us your babble! 
This is no time or place for riddles, 
They’re a matter for these gentlemen. – Solve it! I’ll gladly hear it all again. I fear my old fool’s wandere d far in space:     4755 
Come to my side, here, and take his place. 
 (Mephistopheles places hims elf on the Emperor’s left .) 
 
Murmurs From the Crowd 
 
A newer fool – for newer cares – 
Where’s he from? – How’d he get there? – The old one fell –  He’s all done in – 
He was fat – Now this one’s thin –      4760 
The Emperor 
 
So now, my faithful and beloved, 
Welcome here fro m near and far! 
We meet beneath a lucky star, Since health and lu ck are written above. 
But tell me, why in days like these,      4765 
When we’ve conquered care, And carnival masks are all our wear, 
And delightful things are waiting, 
We trouble ourselves with debating? Yet since you say we have to do it,      4770 
It’s settled then, and we’ll go to it. 
 
The Chancellor 
 
The highest virtue, like a sacred halo 
Circles the Emperor’s head: and so He alone may validly exercise it: 
Justice! – All men love and prize it,      4775 
What all ask, yet wish they could do without, The people look to him to hand it out. 
But ah! What help can human wit deliver, 
Or kindly heart, or willing hand, if fever 
Rages wildly through the state, and evil     4780 Itself is broodingly preparing evil? 
Look about, from this height’s extreme, 
Across the realm: it seem s like some bad dream, 
Where one deformity acts on another, Where lawlessness by law is furthered,     4785 
And an age of crime is discovered. 
Here one steals cattle, there, a wife, Cross, cup and candles tick, from the altar, 
And boasts of it for many a year, 
His skin’s intact, and so’s his life.      4790 Then they take thei r claims to court 
The judge, in pomp, on his high cushion, 
Meanwhile there grows a furious roar, From swelling tides of revolution.  
They insist it’s crime and disgrace,      4795 
With their accomplices beside them, And ‘Guilty!’ is the verdict in a case, 
Only where Innocence is its own defence. 
So all the world will slash and chop, Destroying just what suits themselves:      4800 How then can that true sense develop 
That shows the mo rally acceptable? 
At last the well-intentioned man Yields to the bribe, the flatterer: 
And the judge who can’t convict, is hand     4805 
In hand with the criminal offender. I’ve painted in black, but I’d rather draw 
Its image in the deeper colour that I saw. 
 (Pause ) 
 
The conclusion’s inescapable: If all men suffer when all cause trouble,     4810 Then His Majesty himself is harmed. 
 The Commander in Chief 
 
How riotous things are in this wild age! 
They all lash out, and are lashed, these days, And everyone is deaf to all command. 
The citizen behind his wall,       4815 
The knight in his cliff-top tower, Have sworn to defy us all, And hold fast to their power. 
The impatient mercenaries 
Impetuously demand their pay,       4820 And if we owed th em less, already 
They’d be off, and march away. 
If one forbids what all desire, He’s disturbed a hornet’s nest: 
The kingdom, they should keep entire,      4825 
Is plundered, and distressed. They’d like to wreak a wild disorder, 
Half the world has been dissolved: 
There are still kings beyond our border, But none of them think they’re involved.     4830 
 
The Treasurer 
 
In allies, then, who’d put their trust! 
The subsidies they promised us, 
Like water pipes ar e all blocked up. 
And, Sire, in all your wide estate, 
Who’s benefited from the take?      4835 
Wherever you go, there’s some new pup, Who declares his independence. 
We watch, while they carry on: 
We’ve given away our rights, and hence, No rights are left for us, not one.      4840 
Our parties too, however called, 
Can’t be depended on today: They like to praise, and blame: it’s all Impartial both their love and hate. 
They’re resting: they take cover, 
The Ghibelline, and Guelph.        4845 Now, who’ll help his neighbour?  
Each man just helps himself. 
The golden doors are fastened tight, 
Men scrape and scra tch and glean, all right,     4850 
But our coffers still are empty. 
 
The Steward 
 
What evils, too, I must endure! 
We try to save eac h day, I’m sure, 
But every day sees greater need:      4855 So, daily, some new torment’s mine. 
The cooks, alas, have all they want: 
Boar, pheasant, hare and venison, Ducks and peacocks, chickens, geese, 
Payment in kind, and guaranteed,  
They keep coming all the time,       4860 But in the end we’re short of wine. 
Though cask on cask once filled the cellar, 
The best of vintages, and names, there, These noble lords can drink forever, 
And haven’t left a single drop.       4865 
The council too must have their fill, They grasp their tankards tight until, Under the table, they have to stop. 
Now I’ll count the cost, you’ll see, 
The moneylenders won’t spare me,      4870 The advances that they give gladly, 
Will eat the future years, on top. 
Pigs don’t have time to fatten: instead Men seize the pillows from your bed, 
Even the bread from your table’s gone.     4875 
 The Emperor (After reflection, to Mephistopheles .) 
 
Fool, do you know anything else that’s wrong? Mephistopheles 
 
Me? Nothing at all! I see splendour, as I must, 
Around me, of you and yours! – Lack trust, Where Majesty commands so, without question, 
Where ready force scatters the enemy faction?    4880 
Where strong wills, with wit to understand, Active and various, are all at hand? What, for some evil purpose, could combine, 
For darkness, then, where such stars shine? 
 
Murmurs 
 
Here’s a rogue – who understands –      4885 He’ll tell lies – as long as he can – 
I wonder too – what lies behind – 
And what’s in front? – A project of some kind –  
Mephistopheles 
 
In this world, what isn’t lacking, somewhere, though? 
Sometimes it’s this, or that: here what’s missing’s gold.   4890  
True you can’t just rake it up from the floor, But wisdom knows the mines where one gets more. In mountain veins, foundation walls, 
Coined and un-coined golden hoards, 
And ask me, now, who’ll bring it to the light:    4895 One gifted with Mind’s power and Nature’s might. 
 
The Chancellor 
 
Mind and Nature – don’t speak to Christians so. 
That’s why men burn atheists, below, Such speech is dangerous, all right, 
Nature is sin, and Mind’s the devil,      4900 
It harbours within it, Doubt, that evil, Their misshapen hermaphrodite. Not so with us! – In the Emperor’s land 
Two kinds of men are still at hand 
Worthy alone to defend the throne:      4905 The Saints are they, and the Knights: 
They enter life’s uncertain fights, 
Rewards of Church and State they own: 
Firm in their resistance, check The confused aims of everyman.      4910 
No, Nature and Mind are heretics! 
Wizards! Ruining town and land. And you, with brazen impudence still Invoke them here in this high circle: 
You’re fostering the corrupted will,      4915 
Fools are always hand in hand.  
Mephistopheles 
 
By this I recognise a most learned lord! 
What you can’t feel lies miles abroad, 
What you can’t grasp, you think, is done with too. What you don’t count on can’t be true,     4920 
What you can’t weigh won’t weigh, of old, 
What you don’t coin: that can’t be gold.  
The Emperor 
 
You won’t sort out our faults like that, 
Will Lenten sermons  make men fat? 
I’m tired of the eternal ‘if and when’:      4925 
We’re short of gold, well fi ne, so fetch some then. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I’ll fetch what you wish, and I’ll fetch more: 
Easy it’s true, but then easy things weigh more: 
It’s there already, yet how we might achieve it, That’s the tricky thing, knowin g how to seize it.    4930 
Just think how, in those times of consternation, 
When a human flood drowned land and nation, People were so terrified, everywhere,  They hid their treasures, here and there. 
So it was when mighty Rome held sway,     4935 
And so it goes on, yesterday and today. Still buried in the earth, why, there it is: 
The earth is the Emperor’s, so it’s his. 
 
The Treasurer 
 
For a Fool his aim’s not out of sight: 
It’s true, that’s an old Imperial right.      4940  
The Chancellor 
 
Satan lays out his gilded nets, for you, 
These things don’t square with what’s good and true. 
 
The Steward 
 
Only bring them to court: I’ll welcome the sight, 
And I’ll gladly accept the thing as not quite right. 
 
The Commander in Chief 
 
The Fool’s clever, to promise wh at each of us needs:   4945 
A soldier will never ask fro m whence it all proceeds. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
If you think I’m chea ting you, maybe, 
Why here’s the man: ask Astrology! He knows each circling hour and house: 
So ask him: how are the Heavens now?     4950 
 
Murmurs 
 
Two rogues, there – already known – Fool and Dreamer – so near the throne – 
An idle song – an ancient rhyme – 
The Fool plays – the Wise Man speaks, in time – The Astrologer (Speaks, with Mephistop heles prompting him .) 
 
The Sun, himself, he is of purest gold:      4955 
Mercury, messenger, of riches told: 
Venus has bewitche d you all, and she 
Looks on you, soon and late, quite lovingly: 
The chaste Moon’s mood holds fast: Mars won’t harm: his stre ngth won’t last:     4960 
And Jupiter remains the loveliest sight: 
While Saturn’s great, but far away and slight. 
His metal we don’t gr eatly venerate,  
Light of worth, though leaden in its weight. 
Yes! When Sun and Moon are conjoined fine,    4965 
Silver and gold will make the whole world shine: The rest as well in tu rn are all achieved, 
Palaces, gardens proud, and rosy cheeks: 
All this he brings this highly knowledgeable man: 
He can deliver, too, what nobody else here can.    4970 
 
The Emperor 
 
The words they say, I hear them twice, 
And yet I’m not convinced they’re right.  
Murmurs 
 
What’s all that?  - A joke gone flat – 
Horoscopy – And Chemistry – 
I’ve heard that vein  – Hoped in vain –     4975 
Come, quick – It’s still a trick –  
Mephistopheles 
 
They stand around: they’re all amazed, 
They don’t trust what can be found, 
One babbles about deadly nightshade, The other of some jet-black hound.      4980 What matter if one thinks I’m jesting, 
Or another calls it sorcery, 
If the soles of their feet are itching, If their firm step totters towards me. 
All can feel the secret working       4985 
Of Nature’s everlasting power, 
And from its deepest lurking, A living vein shall rise and flower. 
When every member twitches, 
When all looks strange to your eyes,      4990 Make up your minds, be delvers, Here the players, there the prize! 
 
Murmurs  
It’s like a lead-weight on my feet – 
My arm’s swollen – but then, it’s gouty – There’s a tickle here in my big toe –      4995 
All the way down my back it goes – 
From these signs, I’d say we’re near A rich vein of treasure, here. 
 
The Emperor 
 
Quick then! Don’t slope off there! 
Let’s test your froth of lies,       5000 Show us, all, this rarest prize. I’ll lay down the sword and sceptre, 
With my own noble hands, as well, 
If you don’t lie, complete the work myself, And, if you lie, then send you down to Hell!     5005 
  
Mephistopheles  
I’ll find the way there anyway – 
Yet I really can’t exaggerate What’s lying round ow nerless, everywhere. 
The farmer, ploughing the furrows, lays bare 
A crock of gold the clods unfold:      5010 Seeks saltpetre from damp limy walls, And finds there golden rolls of gold, 
In his poor hands: frightened by all. 
What caverns exist to be blown open, Through what shafts and cuttings then,     5015 
Burrow those gold-divining men, 
Those neighbours of the Underworld! 
Secure in vast ancient cellars, find, Golden plates, bowls, cups for wine, 
In rows, and heaps where they were hurled:     5020 
Goblets fashioned out of rubies, And if they wants to try their uses, Beside them there’s the ancient fluid. 
Yet – I would trust the expert though – 
The wooden casks rotted long ago,      5025 The wine makes tartar, in the liquid. 
Not just gold, and jewels, fine 
But the essence then of noble wine Terror hides, and night, as stark.  
So quiz the wise untiringly:       5030 
It’s trivial, by day, to see:  Mystery: houses in the dark. 
 
The Emperor 
 
See to it then! What use is it out of sight? 
Whatever’s valuable must see the light. Who knows a rogue for certain but by day?     5035 At night all cows are black, and cats are grey. 
The pots down there, full of golden weight – 
Drive your plough, and, ploughing, excavate.  
Mephistopheles 
 
Take hoe and spade: and dig yourself, 
Labouring will make you great,       5040 
A herd of golden calves, you’ll help To rise from out their buried state. 
Then with delight, without delay, 
You can, yourself, your love array: Glittering colours, shining gems, will best     5045 Enhance your majesty, and her loveliness. The Emperor 
 
Quick then, quick! How slow it always is! 
 The Astrologer  (Prompted by Mephistopheles .) 
 
Sire, restrain your urgent passion, please. First let all your pleasant pastimes go: Distracted natures won’t achieve the goal.     5050 
First we must atone for them in quiet, 
Lower things are gained by the higher. Who wants the good, must first be good: 
Who wants delight, must calm the blood: 
Who longs for wine, treads ripened grapes:     5055 Who hopes for miracles, strengthens then his faith. 
 
The Emperor 
 
So let the time be passed in merriment! 
Ash Wednesday will achieve our grave intent. And we can celebrate, wild Carnival, 
More riotously, meanwhile, after all.      5060

Mephistopheles 
 
How merit and luck are linked together 
These fools can’t see, no, not a one:  
If they’d the Philosophe r’s Stone, as ever, 
There’d lack a philosopher for the stone.    Part II Act I Scene III: A Spacious Hall with Adjoining Rooms

In our German lands, fear no evil,      5065 
Dance of Death or Fool, or Devil: There’s a cheerful feast, here: wait. 
Our Sire, on his Roman travels, 
Has, for his profit, and our revels, Crossed the highest Alpine levels,      5070 
And gained himself a happier State. 
The Emperor kissed the holy slipper, First, won sovereign rights, and as, 
He was gifted with the crown, there, 
Accepted a fool’s cap, for us.       5075 We’re all newly born, now: 
Every sophisticated man, 
Pulls it snug over ears and brow: He seems a poor fool, but he’ll vow 
To wear it wisely as he can.       5080 
I see they’re gathering already, Hesitant alone, or paired off intimately: Chorus on chorus pushing through. 
In, and out, quite undeterred: 
And end up where they were before, too.     5085 With its hundred thousand scenes of the absurd, 
The World itself is just one giant Fool. Flower Girls  (Singing, accompanied by mandolins .) 
 
Dressed to win your praises, 
We are here tonight, Young Florentine ladies,        5090 
At the German Court of light. 
 Many a bright flower we wear To adorn our tawny hair: 
Silken threads, silken gear, 
They play their own part here.       5095  
Then our position’s well deserved, oh, 
Worth your praise, without a doubt, Our shining-flowers, by hand we sew, 
So they bloom year in, year out. 
 All kinds of coloured snippets,       5100 
Placed with perfect symmetry: 
You might mock us bit by bit, yes, But the whole attracts you see. 
 
We are pretty things to look on, Flower Girls, and very smart:      5105 Then, the temperament of Woman 
Is so very close to Art. Herald 
 
Let’s see those trays of flowers 
That you carry on your heads, That paint your arms with colours:      5110 
What each likes, let her select. 
Quick: in walks and branches What a garden we will share! They are fit to crowd around us, 
Flower sellers and their wares.       5115 
 
The Flower Girls 
 
Haggle in this cheerful place, 
But seek no market here! 
At a quick and witty pace, 
Let all know what you bear.  
An Olive-Branch with Olives 
 
I don’t envy flowery ones,       5120 
Every kind of strife I shun: 
It’s unnatural, to me: So I am the sign of nations, And I seal their obligations, 
Mark of peace in any field.       5125 
I hope I’m worth good luck today: Some lovely head I might array. 
 
A Garland of Wheat-Ears (Golden ) 
 
Ceres gift, for you to wear, 
Charming, sweet, we  were all sent:  
The most desired of uses, here       5130 
As your beautiful adornment. A Fancy Garland 
 
Like a mallow, bright with colour, 
A marvellous flower grew from the moss! Never known before  to Nature, 
Yet Fashion brought it us.       5135 
 
A Fancy Bouquet  
My name’s for you to know, 
Theophrastus couldn’t tell you though: Yet I hope, if not all do, 
Many of us will still please you, 
She, I’d like, most to possess us,      5140 Who might twine us in her tresses: 
Or if she should so decide, 
Set beside her heart, I’d ride.  
Rosebuds 
 
Many-coloured fancies may 
Form the fashion of the day,       5145 
Strange and curious of shape, Such as Nature never made: Stalks of green and bells of gold, 
Show in tresses all untold! – 
Yet we – remain here, covered up:      5150 Lucky those who first discover us. 
When the summer is proclaimed, 
Then the rosebuds are in flame, Who would do without such pleasures? 
Promises, and yielded treasures,      5155 
That, in the flowery kingdom, rule, Mind and heart and glances, too. 
 
(The Flower Girls garland themselves, a nd show their wares, gracefully, in 
the green leafy arcades .) The Gardeners (Singing, accompanied by lutes .) 
 
See the flowers quietly growing, 
On your brows, sweetly amuse you, And their fruit will not seduce you,      5160 
One may taste delight in knowing.   
 
Sunburned faces offer up, 
Peaches, plums, and cherries, yet. 
Buy! Against the tongue and palate, 
The eye is the worst way to judge.      5165  
Come, of all this ripest fruit, 
Eat with taste, and delight! Poems on roses might still suit, 
But on the apple man must bite. 
 So then let us join with their       5170 
Flowering youth itself, 
And we’ll dress our riper wares In our neighbour’s wealth. 
 
Dressed in cheerful garlands, there, Along this jewelled leafy route,       5175 All things can be found together, 
Buds and leaves, and flowers and fruit. 
 (Both choruses set out their goods on th e flight of steps, with alternating 
song accompanied by the lutes and mando lins, and offer their wares to the 
spectators .) A Mother  (With her daughter .) 
 
Child, when you came to light, 
I dressed you in your little hat: Your face was so sweet and bright,      5180 
And your body was soft, at that. 
I thought you’d soon be a bride, To the wealthiest of men allied, I thought you’d find a match. 
 
Ah! Now already many a year       5185 Has flown by, uselessly, 
The motley crowd of suitors here, 
Pass you quickly by, I see: With him you danced a lively dance, 
Gave that other a knowing glance      5190 
With your elbow, sharply.  
I’ve thought about the many feasts 
We went to, all in vain, Forfeits, and Hide and Seek, 
Couldn’t help, that’s plain:       5195 
Today the fools are out the trap, Darling, open then your lap, There’s someone you can gain. 
 
(Other young and lovely girls join the Flower Girls, and they gossip 
together. Fishermen and bird-catchers w ith fishing rods, nests, limed twigs 
and other implements appear, and sca tter themselves among the girls. 
Mutual attempts to win over, catch,  escape and embrace, allow the most 
agreeable conversation .) 
 
Wood-cutters  (Entering, loudly and boisterously .) 
 
Make way! Stand back! 
We must be free,         5200 We fell the trees, They crash, and smash: 
And when we pass, 
Expect a smack. To give us praise         5205 
Consider this: 
If coarser ways, 
Weren’t in this land, How’d the finest, 
Have means to stand,        5210 
Despite they’re jesting? So learn our meaning! For you’d be freezing, 
If we weren’t sweating. 
 
Pulcinelli 
 
You’re fools, a troop,         5215 
That’s born to stoop. 
We’re the wise, 
We see through lies: And then our bags  
Our caps and rags,         5220 
Are light to wear: And free from care, 
We’re always idle, 
Slippered, we sidle, Through market crowds,        5225 Slithering about, 
Standing to gaze, 
And croak, amazed: And at that sound, 
Through heaving mounds,       5230 
Eel-like slipping, Lightly skipping, 
We romp together. 
Praise us ever, Or scold us so,         5235 
We let both go. 
 The Parasitical (Fawning, and lustful .) 
 
You brave woodsmen, 
And your next of kin, The charcoal-burners, 
You’re the men for us.        5240 
Since all the stooping, 
The ready nodding, The winding phrase, 
That plays both ways, 
That warms or chills,        5245 Just as one feels, What profit is it then? 
The mighty fire 
From heaven or higher,        5250 Might come in vain 
Without logs again, 
And coal heaps there, To light the oven 
And make it glare. 
It roasts and steams,        5255 It boils and teems. 
The finger-picker, 
The plate-licker, He sniffs the fry, 
Suspects the fish:         5260 
Rules, by and by, The patron’s dish.  
A Drunk  (Confused .) 
 Nothing seems bad to me today! 
I feel so frank, and free: 
New joys, and happy songs, I say.      5265 I brought them both with me! 
So let’s drink! Drink, and drink! 
Drink up, you! Clink, and clink! You behind me, come around! 
Drink it up, and send it down.       5270 
 My wife was so outra ged, she screamed, 
When I turned up, dressed so funny, 
However much I boasted, she 
Kept calling me a tailor’s dummy. So I drink! Drink, and drink!       5275 
Clink the tankards! Clink, and clink! 
Tailor’s dummy: swill it round! 
When it’s clinked, drink it down!  
Don’t you say, I’ve lost my way: 
I’m here, where I’ve got it made.      5280 If host and hostess won’t play, I’ll get credit from the maid. 
Always drinking! Drink, and drink! 
Lift, you others! Clink, and clink! Each to each! So it goes round!       5285 
Too soon, I know, it’s all gone down. 
 However I please myself, may I 
Have it happen at my command: 
Let me lie here, where I lie, If I can’t, any longer, stand.       5290 
 
Chorus 
 
Every pal, now: drink and drink! 
A toast again, a clink and clink! Hold tight now to bench and ground! Under the table, he’ll be found.

A Satirical Poet 
 
As a poet, do you know        5295 
What I’d most enjoy, here? 
If I dared to sing, or bellow 
What no one wants to hear.  (The Night and Church Poets excuse th emselves having become engaged in 
a very interesting conversation with a newly-risen Vampire, from which a 
new school of poetry might derive. The He rald has to accept their excuses, and meanwhile calls on characters from  Greek Mythology, who even in 
modern masks lose neither thei r character nor power to charm. ) 
 
(The Three Graces appear .) 
 
Aglaia 
 
Grace it is we bring, to living: So be graceful in your giving.       5300 
 
Hegemone 
 
Gracefully may you receive: 
Lovely is the wish achieved.  
Euphrosyne 
 
And in quieter hours, and places, 
Chiefly, in your thanks, be gracious.   
 
(The Three Fates appear ) 
 
Atropos 
 
I, the eldest, I, the spinning       5305 
Am lumbered with this time: I’ve 
Need of lots of pondering, thinking, To yield the tender threads of life. 
 
So you may be soft and supple, I sift through the finest flax:       5310 
Drawn through clever fingers, double 
Fine, and even, smooth as wax.  
If you wish all joy and dancing, 
Excessive now, in what you take,  Think about those threads: their ending.     5315 Then, take care! The threads might break. 
 
 Clotho 
 
Know that in these latter days, 
I was trusted with the shears: Since our eldest sister’s ways, 
Failed to help men, it appears.       5320 
 She dragged all her useless spinning, Endlessly to air and light, 
While the hopes of wondrous winnings, 
Were clipped and buried out of sight.  
I too made a host of errors:       5325 
Myself, in my younger years, But, to keep myself in check, there’s 
The case, in which I keep my shears. 
 And so, willingly restrained, 
I look kindly on this place,       5330 
In these hours, your freedom gained, Run on and on, at your wild pace. 
 
Lachesis 
 
I, the only one with sense, 
To twist the threads am left: 
My ways brook no nonsense,        5335 I’ve never hurried yet. 
 
Threads they come, threads I wind, Guiding each one on its track, 
Letting no thread wander blind, 
Twining each one in the pack.       5340  
If I, once, forgot myself, my fears 
For the world would give me pause: Counting hours, measuring years, So the Weaver holds her course. Herald  
 
You wouldn’t recognise the ones who come now,    5345 
However much you know of ancient troubles, To look at them, the cause of many evils, 
You’d call them welc ome guests, and bow. 
 They’re the Furies: no one will believe me, Pretty, shapely, friendly, young in years:     5350 
But meet with them, you’ll quickly learn I fear, 
How serpent-like these doves are to hurt freely.  
Though they’re malicious, in modernity,  
Where fools now boast about their sinful stories, They too have ceased to want  the Angels’ glories:    5355 
Confess themselves the pl ague of land and city. 
 (The Furies approach .) 
 
Alecto 
 
What does that matter? You still believe in us: 
Then, we’re pretty, young, and fawning kittens: If one of you has a lover, with whom he’s smitten, 
We’ll tickle his ears at length, sweetly fuss,      5360 
 
Till it would be safe to tell him, eye to eye, That she waves to him, and him, the same, 
She’s thick up top, a crooked back, and lame,  
And married, she’d be no good, by and by.  
We know how to pester the bride-to-be as well:    5365 
Scarcely a week ago, her lover himself, Said nasty things to her about herself! – 
They’re reconciled, but so mething rankles still.  Megaera 
 
That’s a joke! Let them be married, any way, 
I’ll take it up, and know, what ever may befall,    5370 
Through wilfulness the sweetest joys will pall, 
Man’s changeable, and changeable the day. 
 And no one holds the desired one in his arms, Without longing, foolishly, for the more-desired, 
Leave’s his good fortune, with wh ich he was fired:    5375 
Flies from the sun, and asks the frost for warmth.  
I know how to give birth to those things: there, 
Is Asmodi, who is my faithful servant, To work true mischief at the proper moment, 
And send to ruin all Mankind, in pairs.     5380 
 
Tisiphone 
 
Instead of malice: poison and the knife 
I’m mixing, sharpening for that betrayer: 
Love another, and s ooner now or later, 
Ruin itself will penetrate your life.   Gall and wormwood they must roam      5385 
Through all those sweetest moments! 
No bargaining here, no bartering, come – The perpetrator must atone. 
 
Let no one sing about forgiveness! I cry my cause to the cliffs again,      5390 
Echo! Hear! Reply: Avenge! 
Let him who alters, cease existence.  
The Herald 
 
I’ll ask you please, to move aside,      5395 
Since what comes next, is otherwise. 
You can see, here’s  a mountain coming, 
Decked with princely coloured trappings, A tusked head, snaking trunk, there too, 
A mystery, but I’ll reveal the key to you. 
A delicate and dainty girl sits on its neck, 
And with a thin wand keeps the beast in check:    5400 Another, up there, standing, wonderfully, 
Surrounded with light, almost blinding me. 
Beside it, two girls walk in chains, one fearful, While the other girl seems quite cheerful: One wishes to be, and one f eels she is, free.     5405 
Let each of them decl are who they might be. 
 
Fear 
 
Smoking torches, flares and lights, 
Are burning at the troubled feast: 
Among all these deceptive sights, 
Ah, I’m held fast by the feet.       5410  
Away, you ridiculous smilers! 
I suspect those grins so bright: All my enemies, beguilers, 
Press towards me through the night. 
 Here! A friend becomes a foe,       5415 Yet I know that mask, I’d say: 
One that wants to kill me, though, 
Now unmasked he creeps away.  
Gladly, heedless of direction 
I’d escape from out this world:       5420 But, beyond, there roars destruction: 
In mists of terror I am furled. 
 
Hope 
 
I greet you, sisters! Though today, 
And the whole of yesterday, You enjoyed the masquerade,       5425 
I know all will be displayed: 
In the morning you’ll unveil. And if, in the torchlight, we 
Don’t feel particular delight, 
Yet the days to come, so bright,       5430 
More wholly suited, we shall hail, Now as one, now solitary, 
Through fair fields, we’ll roam loose, 
To act, or rest, as we choose, And in that carefree way of living,      5435 Dispense with nothing, go on striving: 
Guests are welcome everywhere, 
Confidently, let’s appear: Surely, the best anywhere, 
Must be somewhere, here.        5440 
 
Intelligence 
 
Two of Man’s worst enemies, 
Fear and Hope, I bind for you, 
Now this country worries me. 
Make room! I’ll rescue you.  
I lead the living Colossus,       5445 
Turret-crowned, as you see, Step by step, he crosses, The highest passes, tirelessly. 
 
But above me, on the summit, Is a goddess, there, who’s bearing      5450 
Outspread wings, and turns about, 
Everywhere, to see who’s winning.   
Ringed by splendour, and by glory,  
Shining far, on every side: She calls herself – Victory,       5455 
Goddess of the active life. 
 Zoilo-Thersites (An Ugly Dwarfish Warrior .) 
 
Ah, ha! I’ve come just in time, 
I hold you all guilty of crime! Yet my goal I assume to be 
Her up there: Queen Victory.       5460 
With her pair of snowy wings, 
She’s an eagle, she must think: And that whenever she’s on hand, 
To her belong the folk and land: 
But when famous deeds are done,      5465 At once I’m here with armour on, When low is high, and high is low, 
Bent is straight, and straight not so, 
That alone fills me with mirth, I wish it so throughout the Earth.      5470 
 
The Herald 
 
So I’ll lend you, dog from birth, 
This good baton’s masterstroke! Twist and turn now: it’s no joke! – 
See how the twin dwarfish ape, 
Rolls into a foul lumpish shape!       5475 A wonder – the lump’s an egg, on cue, 
It swells and then it cracks in two: 
Now a pair of twins appear, An adder and a bat roll clear. One through the dust is swiftly winding,     5480 
The black one’s flitting round the ceiling. 
They hurry outside, in company, I wouldn’t choose to be number three. 
 
Murmurs 
 
Lively now! There’s dancing there – 
No! I’d much rather be elsewhere  –       5485  
Can’t you feel some ghostly race 
Fly about us, through this place? – 
Something just rushed through my hair – Round my feet, it’s flying, where? – None of us are injured though –       5490 
But we all are frightened so – 
All the fun is spoilt completely – As those creatures wished, you see. 
 
The Herald 
 
Since I play the herald’s role, 
As this masquerade unfolds,       5495 
I watch sternly at the door, In case some devious outlaw To this happy place, comes creeping: 
Never yielding, never wavering. 
Through the window, though, I fear      5500 Airborne spectres enter here: 
From magic and from devilry 
Alas, I cannot set you free. All this makes the dwarf suspicious, 
Now! From behind, a new masque issues.     5505 
And I must dutifully explain The meaning of the forms, again. 
But I can’t easily announce 
What cannot be understood: Help me explain it, if you would! –      5510 
See it wander through the crowd? 
A splendid chariot, a four-in-hand, Rolling through them, where they stand: But it doesn’t split the people, 
I see no one’s crushed at all.       5515 
Colours glitter in the distance, Sundry wandering stars for instance, 
A magic-lantern-like performance. 
It blows along, a storm’s assault.  Make way, there! I shudder! 
 
The Boy Charioteer 
       Halt!      5520 
Dragons, your wings restrain, 
Feel your accustomed rein, Control yourselves, if I control you, Sweep away when I inspire you – 
Let us do honour to this place!       5525 
Look round, a widening display Of admirers, circle now on circle. 
Herald, now, then! As you will, 
Before we leave you all, 
Describe us, and say our name:       5530 Since we’re allegorical, 
You should know us, plain. 
 
Herald 
 
No, indeed, I can’t tell your name: 
I’ll try and describe you all the same.  
The Boy Charioteer 
 
So try! 
 
The Herald 
   
    I must confess     5535 
To young and handsome, before the rest. 
You’re a half-grown boy: yet a woman 
Would prefer to see you fully grown. 
You seem to me a wooer, in future, 
Out of her house, a real seducer.      5540  
The Boy Charioteer 
 
Let’s hear more! Go on: go on, 
Find the riddle’s bright solution. 
   
The Herald 
 
Dark eyes that shine: night-black hair 
Which brightly jewelled bands enclose: 
And what a dainty garment flows      5545 
From shoulder down to ankle, there: With purple hem its glittering shows! One might take you for a girl: 
Yet for good or ill, you’d be, 
Prized already by any girl,       5550 She’d teach you your ABC. 
 
The Boy Charioteer 
 
And he, who like a splendid vision, 
Sits on the chariot, enthroned there? 
 
The Herald  
He seems a king, a rich and kind one, 
Blessed are they who gain his favour!      5555 He has no further need to strive, 
His eyes observe whatever’s lacking, 
And to spread his pure delight, Is more to him than joy and owning. 
 
The Boy Charioteer 
 
You daren’t stop there: what you see,      5560 
You must describe it precisely.  
The Herald 
 
I can’t express all the dignity. 
But the glowing moon face, I see, 
The full mouth, the bright cheeks, then 
That shine beneath the jewelled turban:     5565 Rich comfort in the clothes he’s wearing! 
What shall I say about his bearing? 
As a ruler he seems known to me.  
The Boy Charioteer 
 
Plutus the God of Riches, this is he! 
He’s come himself in all his splendour,     5570 
The Emperor wished greatly he were here.   The Herald 
 
Explain your own what  and how to me! 
 
The Boy Charioteer 
 
I am Extravagance: I am Poetry: 
I am the Poet, who is self-perfected When his special gift is squandered.      5575 
Yet I’m immeasurably wealthy, 
Like Plutus, worth as much as he, I adorn, enliven, dance and feast, 
And whatever he lacks, I complete.  
 
Herald 
 
Your boasting makes you handsomer,      5580 
But let’s see all your skill appear. 
 
The Boy Charioteer 
 
Just watch me snap  my fingers, now, 
The chariot will gleam and glow. There a string of pearls appear!  
(He continues to snap his fingers, in all directions .) 
 Golden jewels for neck and ear:       5585 
Flawless combs and diadems, 
Set in a ring, rare precious gems: I scatter flames too,  here and there, 
Waiting for their chance to flare. 
 
The Herald 
 
How the dear crowd snat ch, I see!      5590 
The giver’s soon in difficulty. He snaps out jewels, as in a dream, 
And they all snatch them, in a stream. 
But now a different trick, you see: What each has grasped so eagerly,      5595 
Has gained him but a poor reward, 
The gifts already fluttering skyward. 
The pearls are loosened from their band, And beetles crawl there in his hand, 
The poor man shakes them off, instead     5600 
They’re humming now around his head. Another, for some solid thing, Catches at a butterfly’s wing. 
That’s what the rascal’s promise means: 
He only lends them golden gleams!      5605  
The Boy Charioteer 
 
You know how to announce masks: it’s true, 
But it’s not the herald’s task to search below 
The outer surface of existence: That requires a keener sense. 
Still I’m wary of all disputes.       5610 
Lord, I’ll direct my speech  and questioning to you. 
 
(Turning towards Plutus .) 
 Have you not trusted me with the task, to stand  And guide the tempest of your four-in-hand? 
Don’t I steer well, as you direct? 
Am I not there, when you expect?      5615 And don’t I know how to win 
The palm, for you, on daring wing? 
When I’ve fought for you in war, now, I’ve been successful every time: 
When laurel wreaths adorn your brow      5620 
Have I not fashioned th em with hand and mind? 
 
Plutus 
 
If I’m required to be a witness to it, 
I’d say: You are the spirit of my spirit. 
You always act according to my wishes, 
And as I gain myself, you too are richer.     5625 To reward your services, I value now 
The green branch high er than my crown. 
One true word, then, for everyone: 
I’ve found delight in you, dear Son.  
The Boy Charioteer 
 
The greatest gifts from my hand,      5630 
See! I’ve scattered them around. 
On every head there’s the glow 
Of some little flame I throw: Leaping from one brow to another, 
Halts on him, then leaves his brother,      5635 
But rarely does the flame-let rise, And briefly flower in bright skies: 
For many, before they know, it’s vanished, 
Sadly, it’s burnt out, and finished.   
Women (Chatting to each other .) 
 
Up there, on the four-in-hand,       5640 
He’s certainly a charlatan: 
And there’s a clown perched behind, By hunger and thirst he’s been refined, Like nothing one’s ever seen before: 
Pinch, and he’ll feel nothing at all.      5645 
 
The Starveling 
 
Disgusting women, leave me alone! 
Not to come here again, I’ll know. 
When women kept to their hearths, then 
Avaritia , Greed: was my name: 
The houses were fine, all about,       5650 
Lots came in, nothing went out! 
I took care of cupboard and chest: That was a burden, to top the rest. But now in this younger age, 
Wives don’t know how to save,       5655 
And like all those wicked students, They have more desires than ‘talents’, 
And their men have much to suffer, 
Their debts are left about all over. 
They spend whatever they can extract,      5660 On their lovers, and on their backs: 
They eat of the best, and drink deeper, 
With their wretched army of admirers: Which adds to the value of gold, for me: We’re manly fellows, the Miserly!      5665 
 
Leader of the Women 
 
Let dragon be mise rly with dragon: 
In the end it’s merely lies, illusion! Men flock around, and turn the charm on, 
But they’re soon annoya nce and confusion. 
 
The Crowd of Women 
 
That Scarecrow! Give him a poke!      5670 What’s the Wooden Rake threaten?  
We’ll all shun his ugly looks, then! 
Dragons of wood and paper: a joke! Look lively, now, and we’ll do him in!  
The Herald 
 
By my wand! Keep the peace! –      5675 
Though there’s no need for my assistance: 
Look at those grim monsters, how each Clears round itself a proper distance, 
Unfolding its quadruple wings, the beast. 
The dragons shake themselves, indignant,     5680 With fiery throats, their tails rampant: 
The place is cleared: the people flee.  
 (Plutus descends from the chariot .) The Herald 
 
He steps down, in a kingly manner! 
He beckons, and the dragons stir: From the chariot bearing Avarice,      5685 
And gold, down comes the chest, 
See, there at his feet, it’s landed: It’s a wonder how it happened. 
 
Plutus (To the Boy Charioteer ) 
 
Now you’ve left that troubling burden here, 
You’re free: so, fly now to your own sphere!     5690 
Not this! Where, confused, motley, wild, Distorted objects crowd around us, child. 
No: where you see clear, w ith sweetest Clarity, 
Self-possessed, trusting in  your own self: flee, 
Where Goodness and Beauty may be viewed,    5695 
And there create your world – in Solitude! 
 
The Boy Charioteer 
 
So, I’ll be your worthy envoy then, 
So, I’ll love you like my dearest kin. Where you live, is Plenty: and where 
I am, all feel they gain in splendour.       5700 
And often hesitate in life’s uncertainty: Should they yield to you, or yield to me? 
Certainly your followe rs will have rest: 
Who follows me, with wo rk’s forever blessed. 
My actions are never kept a secret,      5705 
I only have to breathe  and I’m apparent. 
Farewell, then! You gr anted me my joy: 
But whisper low, and you shall have your boy! 
 
(He exits as he came .) Plutus (Faust in disguise .) 
 
And now it’s time to reveal the treasure! 
I strike the lock with the herald’s wand.     5710 It’s open! Look! Vessels  of noblest measure, 
Pour the golden blood through your hands, 
First it swells, roars, writhes as if it’s molten: A jewelled hoard of crowns, rings, and chains.  
Various Shouts from the Crowd. 
 
Look here, oh, there! How rich it flows:     5715 
The chest, right to the brim, it glows. – 
Golden vessels, molten too, Rolls of coins, turning too. – 
Minted ducats leaping, 
Oh, how my heart is beating –       5720 I see all, for which I’m yearning, 
On the floor there, burning! – 
It’s offered you, don’t be a fool, Be rich, you only need to stoop. – 
For, quick as lightning, all the rest,      5725 
Will take possession of the chest.  
The Herald 
 
What’s this, you Fools? Ah, yes, 
It’s no more than a maskers’ jest. 
Tonight, don’t ask for any more: 
Think you, we’d give you golden ore?      5730 In this game there are any amount 
Of pennies: too many for you to count. 
You clumsy idiots! A fine appearance, Seems, to you, trut h’s naked essence. 
What is your Truth? – Hollow illusion      5735 
Grasps you, with its fool’s cap on. – Heroic Mask, Plutus that conceals, Drive these folk, then, from the field. 
 Plutus 
 
Your wand’s best by a mile, 
Lend it me for a little while. –       5740 I’ll dip it, quick, in heat and glow. – 
You Maskers, all take care then, now! 
It gleams and bursts and throws off sparks! The wand already shines in the dark. And anyone who gets too near me,      5745 
Will be scorched, as well, mercilessly. – 
And now I’ll sweep with my brand.  
Shouts and Confusion 
 
Ah! We’re done for every man. – 
Fly, now, whoever can! – 
Back, back, the hindmost man! –      5750 It’s shining brightly in my eyes. – 
On me the wand’s hot weight lies – 
We’re all lost, lost for good. – Back, back, you masks in flood! 
Back, back, you senseless mob! –      5755 
If I’d wings, I’d soar aloft. –  
Plutus 
 
The circle backwards sinks, 
Yet no one’s scorched, I think. 
The crowd will now give way, 
They’re only scared I’d say. –       5760 But to guarantee good order, 
I’ll mark out an unseen border. 
 
The Herald 
 
You’ve done a fine job all right, 
Thanks to your cunning, and might. Plutus 
 
Noble friend, you’ll still need patience:     5765 
All kinds of turmoil still threaten us.  
Avarice 
 
Now, if it pleases you, you may 
Cast your eye around with pleasure: 
The women are to th e fore as ever, 
Where they can nibble things, or gaze.      5770 Still, I’m not completely rusty! 
A lovely woman’s always lovely: 
And since, today, it costs me nothing, With confidence, I too go wooing. 
Still, here, in such a crowded space,      5775 
Lest words fall in an idle place, I’ll try being clever, attempt success, 
And in clear mime make my address. 
Hands, feet, gesturing won’t cut the ice, So, I’ll have to employ a comical device.     5780 
I’ll shape the gold like moistened clay, 
Since the metal’s malleable anyway.  
The Herald 
 
What’s he up to that skinny Fool! 
Is there a jest in the starveling too? 
He kneads the gold just like dough,      5785 
It’s soft between his hands, although However he squeezes  and forms it all, 
It still remains a shapeless ball.  
He turns now towards the women, They all scream, and start to run,      5790 
Gesturing in complete disgust: 
That rascal’s up to no good. I fear he’ll be in ecstasy If he can offend morality. 
I shan’t remain silent, anyway       5795 
Give me the wand: I’ll drive him away.  
Plutus 
 
He doesn’t see what we threaten here: 
Let him pursue his foolishness! 
There’ll be no room left for his excess: 
The law is great, but necessity’s greater.     5800  
Tumult and Singing 
 
The wild crowd come here, specially, 
From mountain-top, and wooded valley, 
Shouting forcefully, as they can: 
They celebrate the great god Pan.      5805 They know what none can know, 
And into the empty circle flow. 
 
Plutus 
 
‘I know you well, a nd your great Pan! 
Together these daring steps you plan. 
I know all that no one knows, 
And clear for you this narrow close.’      5810 May good fortune follow them too! The strangest things may happen: 
They don’t know where they’re going to: 
Since they never look before them.  
Wild Singing 
 
You plaster people: you tinsel show!      5815 
Rough and coarse is how they go, 
Leaping: wild is their track ahead, Solid and  sturdy is their tread.  Fauns 
 
The Faun flocks 
In happy dance,         5820 Oaken garlands, 
On curling  locks,  
Fine pointed ears Through tangled hair, Snub noses, faces broad and flat,      5825 
The women can’t fault any of that: 
When the Fauns begin to prance, The loveliest won’t scorn the dance. 
 
A Satyr 
 
The Satyr’s leaping here behind, 
Goat’s foot, and lean of thigh,       5830 Sinewy, skinny he’ll go by, 
And chamois-like, on mountain height, 
He looks around, and takes delight. He’s alive in the free air, 
Mocks at man, child, woman there,      5835 
Who deep in the valley’s damp flue, Think, cosily, they’re living too, While, still pure and undisturbed, 
To him alone is the upper world. 
 
The Gnomes 
 
The little crowd trips by there,       5840 
They don’t like to travel in pairs: 
In mossy clothes with lanterns bright, 
They pass together, quick and light, Each one passing on his own, 
Like glowing ants swarming home:      5845 
And always busy, here and there, Industrious, and everywhere. Kin to the ‘Little People’, known 
As surgeons to the rock and stone: 
‘We bleed the mountains high,       5850 We drain the deep veins dry: 
We hurl the metals round, 
With hearty greetings: Luck! Well found! 
And it’s always kindly meant: again, We’re the friends of all good men.      5855 
Yet we the gold to light deliver, 
So men may steal, and covet ever, So princely hand won’t lack the steel That worldwide murd er longs to deal. 
Who those three commandments breaks     5860 
Scant heed of the other seven takes. But of all that we’re innocent: 
About it all, like us, be patient.’ 
 
The Giants 
 
The wild men, we are named, 
Known in all the Hartz range:       5865 
Natural, plain, in all our antics, 
Appearing frightfully gigantic. A fir-tree trunk in each right hand, 
Round our body a thick band, 
A solid apron of branches, not       5870 The bodyguard the Pope has got.  
Nymphs in Chorus  (Surrounding Great Pan, who is the masked Emperor .) 
 Here he’ll stand! – 
The world’s All, 
Is shown to all, In mighty Pan.         5875 
You the happiest, surround him, 
In magic dances soar around him: Here now, serious and good, he 
Wishes all men to be happy. 
Under the curving roof of blue       5880 He seems endlessl y wakeful, too, 
Yet the streams flow gently for him, 
And the breezes gently rock him, 
And, when he sleeps at noon, the leaf Is motionless in the branches’ wreath:      5885 
The rich plants’ fragrant balsams there 
Fill all the still and silent air: 
The Nymph no longer dares to leap, And where she stands, falls fast asleep. 
But when his powerful shout,       5890 
Unexpectedly, rings out, Like thunder crack, or wave’s roar, Who knows what’s ha ppening any more, 
The army’s witless in the fight, 
The hero in battle’s filled with fright.      5895 So honour him, where honour’s due, 
And hail him, who led us to you! 
 A Deputation of Gnomes (To Great Pan .) 
 
When the rich and shining goods, Spread threadlike through the deep, 
Then delicate divining rods,       5900 
Reveal what labyrinths keep.  
 
Bending in our dark vaults, there, 
As troglodytes we’re measured, While in the purest daylight air, Gracious, you divide the treasure.      5905 
 
Now we find we’ve discovered A marvellous fountain here, 
Promising, easily, to deliver 
Things that infrequently appear.  
It all waits for your command:       5910 
Master, take and care for it: do. Every treasure in your hand, 
Helps the whole world too. Plutus  (To the Herald .) 
 
We must grasp things in the highest sense, 
And let what may come, come , with confidence.    5915 
You’ve shown the highest courage once before. 
So now too what is fearful, we must try it: 
World, and posterity, will stubbornly deny it, So pen it faithfully in your report.  
The Herald (Grasping the wand in Plutus’ hand, and assisting with the 
Masquerade .) 
 
The dwarves lead on great Pan,       5920 
Gently, to the fiery fountain: It boils from the deep profound, 
Then sinks again, through the ground, 
And gloomy is its open round: Yet shows again the heat and glow.      5925 
Great Pan stands there, well disposed, 
Pleased with all this wondrous thing, Pearl foam, right, left, showering. 
How can he trust such a show? 
He bends to look inside, and so,       5930 His beard gets caught within! – Who’s made that hairless chin? 
His hand hides it from our vision. – 
What follows is all clumsy action: The beard, on fire, flies back, soon      5935 
Scorching garland, chest and head: 
Delight is turned to pain instead. – They rush to quench it all again, 
But none of them are free of flames, 
And how they flare and dart,       5940 Exciting fire in every part: 
Wreathed in that element, 
The whole masked crowd is burnt. But what’s all this news about, Ear after ear, mouth after mouth!      5945 
O eternally unlucky night 
So little of it’s turned out right! Tomorrow’s dawn will declare 
What nobody wants to hear: 
In every ear we’ll hear it plain:       5950 
‘The Emperor is in such pain.’ O, would that it were something other! 
Burnt, Emperor and Court together. 
Cursed be those who led him astray, In resinous twigs did him array,       5955 To rage, and bellow out that song, 
To the ruin of all that throng. 
O Youth, Youth will you never Restrict joy’s purest measure? 
O Power, Power, will you never,      5960 
Sense and Omnipotence treasure? 
The ‘forest’ too is soon in flames, 
The pointed tongues play their games, 
To the real wooden beams lick higher: We’re threatened by universal fire.      5965 
The cup of misery overflows, 
Who will save us? No one knows. See, Imperial splendour, by dawn’s light, 
Turned to a heap of ash, in a single night. 
 
Plutus 
 
That’s enough terror overhead,       5970 
Let help arrive here, instead! – Strike, you heavenly wand, with power, 
So the earth will ring and tremor! 
You, the wide realms of air, Fill with cool fragrance there!       5975 
Hurry down, to sweep around us, 
Cloudy mists and swelling vapours, Quench the thronging flames!  
Murmuring, trickling, fogs gather, 
Sliding, rolling, softly drenching,      5980 Slipping everywhere, and quenching. You, the moist, who soothe forever, 
Change them all to gleaming weather, 
All these empty fiery games! –  Threatening Spirits, that would harm,      5985 
We, by magic, will disarm. Part II Act I Scene IV: A Plea sure Garden in the Morning Sun 
 
(The Emperor, his Court, Noblemen and Ladies: Faust and Mephistopheles 
dressed fashionably but not ostentatiously, both kneel .) 
 
Faust 
 
Sire, forgive the fiery conjuring tricks?  
The Emperor (Beckoning to him to rise .) 
 More fun, in that vein, would be my wish. – 
At once, I saw myself in a glowing sphere, 
It seemed as if I were divine Pluto, there.     5990 A rocky depth of mine, and darkness, lay 
Glowing with flame: out of each vent played 
A thousand wild and whirling fires, And flickered in the vault together, higher, 
Licking upwards to the highest dome,      5995 
That now seemed ther e, and now was gone. 
Through a far space wound with fiery pillars, 
I saw a long line of people approach us, 
Crowding till they formed a circle near, And paid me homage, as th ey do forever.     6000 
From Court, I knew one fa ce, and then another’s, 
I seemed the Prince of a thousand salamanders. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
You are, Sire! Since every element Knows your Majesty,  amongst all men. 
You’ve now proved the fire obedient:      6005 
Leap in the sea, in its wildest torrent, You’ll barely touch its pearl-strewn bed, 
A noble dome will rise round you, instead: 
You’ll see green translucent waves swelling Purple edged, to make the loveliest dwelling,    6010 
And you will be its centre. At each step 
Wherever you go, the palace follows yet, 
The very walls themselves delight in life, Flash to and fro, in swarming arrow-flight. 
Sea-wonders crowd around this sweet new sight,    6015 
Shoot past, still not allowed to enter quite. 
There, golden-scaled, br ight sea-dragons play, 
The shark gapes wide, you smile in his face. 
However much your c ourt attracts you now, 
You’ve never seen such an amazing crowd.     6020 Nor will you part there from the loveliest: The Nereids will be gathering, curious, 
To this wondrous house, in seas eternally fresh, 
The youngest shy and pleasure-loving, like fish, The old ones: cunning. Thetis at the news,     6025 
Gives hand and lips to this second Peleus. – 
A seat there, on the height of Olympus, too…  
The Emperor 
 
I’ll leave the airy spaces all to you: 
Soon enough we’ll be climbing to that throne. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
And, Sire, the Earth alrea dy is your own!     6030 
  
The Emperor 
 
What brought you here, now: what good fortune, Straight from the Thousand Nights and One? 
If you’re as fertile as Scheherezade 
I’ll guarantee you a sublime reward. Be ready then, when your world’s light,     6035 
As it often does, disappoints me quite. 
 The Steward (Entering hastily .) 
 
Your Supreme Highne ss, I never thought  
To announce such luck, the finest wrought, As this is, for me the greatest blessing, 
Which I’ve revealed in your presence:      6040 
For debt after debt I’ve accounted, The usurer’s claws now are blunted, 
I’m free of Hell’s pain, and then, 
It can’t be any brighter in Heaven. 
 The Commander in Chief (Follows hastily .) 
 
Something’s paid of what we owe,      6045 
The Army’s all renewed their vow, The Cavalry’s fresh blood is up, 
And girls and landlords can sup.  
 
The Emperor 
 
Now your chests breathe easier! Now your furrowed brows are clear!      6050 
How quickly you hurried to the hall! 
 
The Treasurer (Appearing .) 
 
Ask them : it was they who did it all. 
 
Faust 
 
It’s right the Chancellor should read the page. 
 
The Chancellor  (Coming forward slowly .) 
 I’m happy enough to do so, in my old age. – 
See and hear the scroll, hea vy with destiny,     6055 
That’s changed to happiness, our misery. ‘To whom it concerns , may you all know, 
This paper’s worth a thousand crowns, or so. 
As a secure pledge, it will underwrite, All buried treasure, our Emperor’s right.     6060 
Now, as soon as the treasure’s excavated, 
It’s taken care of, and well compensated.’ The Emperor 
 
I smell a fraud, a monstrous imposture! 
Who forged the Emperor’s signature?       Have they gone unpunished fo r their crime?      6065 
 
The Treasurer 
 
Remember! You yourself it was that signed: 
Last night. You acted as great Pan, 
Here’s how the Chancellor’s speech began: ‘Grant yourself this great festive pleasure, 
The People’s Good: a few strokes of the feather.’    6070 
You wrote it here, and while night ruled the land, A thousand artists created another thousand, 
So all might benefit from your good deed, 
We stamped the whole series with your screed, Tens, Thirties, Fifties, H undreds, all are done.    6075 
You can’t think how well the folk get on. 
See your city once ha lf-dead with decay, 
Now all’s alive, enjoying its new day! 
Though your name’s long filled the world with glee, 
They’ve never gazed at it so happily.      6080 Now the alphabet’s superfluous, In these marks there’s bliss for all of us. 
 
The Emperor 
 
And my people value it as gold, you say? 
The Court and Army treat it as real pay? Then I must yield, though it’s wonderful to me.      6085 
 
The Steward 
 
It was impossible to catch the escapee: 
It flashed like lightning through the land: The moneychanger’s shops are jammed, Men pay, themselves, the papers mount 
They’re gold and silver, and at a discount.     6090 
Now used by landlords, butchers, bakers: Half the world think they’re merrymakers, 
The others, newly clothed, are on show. 
The drapers cut the cloth: the tailors sew. 
The toast is ‘Hail, the Emperor!’ in the bars,     6095 With cooking, roasting, tinkling of jars. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Strolling, lonely, on the terrace, 
You see a beauty, smartly dressed, 
One eye hidden by he r peacock fan, 
She smiles sweetly, looks at your hand:     6100 
And, quicker than wit or eloquence, 
Love’s sweetest favour’s arranged at once.  You’re not plagued w ith pouch or wallet, 
A note beneath the heart, install it, 
Paired with love-letters, conveniently.      6105 The priest carries his in a breviary,  
And wouldn’t the soldier be quicker on his way, 
With a lighter belt around his middle, say. Your Majesty will forgive me if, in miniature, 
I produce a low note, in our high adventure.     6110 
 
Faust 
 
The wealth of treasur e that solidifies, 
That in your land, in deep earth lies, Is all unused. In our boldest thought, 
Such riches are only feebly caught: 
Imagination, in its highest flight,      6115 Strives to, but can’t reach that height. 
But grasping Spirits, worthy to look deeply, 
Trust in things without limit, limitlessly.  
Mephistopheles 
 
Such paper’s convenient, for rather than a lot Of gold and silver, you know what you’ve got.     6120 
You’ve no need of bartering and exchanging, 
Just drown your needs in wine and love-making. If you lack coin, there’s moneychangers’ mile, 
And if it fails, you dig the ground a while.  
Cups and chains are auctioned: well,      6125 
Since the paper, in this way, pays for itself, It shames the doubters, and their acid wit, 
People want nothing else, they’re used to it. 
So now in all of your Imperial land You’ve gems, gold, paper enough to hand.     6130  
The Emperor 
 
The Empire thanks you deeply for this bliss: 
We want the reward to  match your service. 
We entrust you with the riches underground, You are the best custodians to be found. 
You know the furthest well-concealed hoard,    6135 
And when men dig, it’s you must give the word. You masters of our treasure, then, unite, 
Accept your roles with honour and delight: 
They make the Underw orld, and the Upper, 
Happy in their agreement, fit together.      6140 
 
The Treasurer 
 
No dispute will divide us in the future: 
I’m happy to have a wizard for a partner. 
 (He exits with Faust .) 
 
The Emperor 
 
Now, presents for the court: everyone 
Confess to me whatever it is you want.  
A Page (Accepting his present .) 
 
I’ll live well, happy, have the best of things.     6145 Another (Also.) 
 
I’ll quickly buy my lover chains and rings. 
 
A Chamberlain 
 
I’ll drink wines that are twice as fine. 
 
A Second Chamberlain 
 
The dice in my pockets itch I find. 
 
A Knight (Thoughtfully .) 
 
My lands and castle will be free of debt. 
 
A Second Knight 
 
It’s treasure: a second treasure I will get.     6150 
 
The Emperor 
 
I hoped for desire and c ourage for new deeds: 
But whoever knows you, thinks you slight indeed. I see, clearly: despite this treasure and more, 
You’re all the same, s till, as you were before. 
 The Fool  (Recovered, and approaching the throne .) 
 
You’re handing presents out: give me one too!    6155  
The Emperor 
 
Alive again? You’d drink it all you fool. 
 
The Fool 
 
Magic papers! I don’t understand them, truly. 
 The Emperor 
 
That I’d believe: you’ll only use them badly. 
 
The Fool 
 
Others are falling: I don’t know what to do. 
 
The Emperor 
 
Just pick them up: those are all yours too.     6160 
 
(The Emperor exits .) 
 
The Fool 
 
Five thousand crowns I’m  holding, in my hand! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
You two-legged wineskin, so you still stand? 
 
The Fool 
 
I’ve had my luck, but this is the best yet. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
You’re so delighted: look, it’s made you sweat. 
 
The Fool 
 
But see here, is it truly worth real gold?     6165  
Mephistopheles 
 
You’ve there just what belly and throat are owed. The Fool 
 
And can I buy a cottage, cow and field? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Why yes! There’s nothing to it: make a bid.  
The Fool 
 
A castle: with forest s, hunting, fishing? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
               Trust me! 
To see you a proper Lord woul d make me happy!    6170 
 
The Fool 
 
Tonight I’ll plant my weight on what I’ll get! – 
 
(He Exits .) 
 
Mephistopheles  
Who doubts now that our Fool’s full of wit! Part II Act I Scene V: A Gloomy Gallery 
 
(Faust. Mephistopheles .) 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Why bring me here to this dark passage? 
Isn’t there fun enough inside, In the Court’s colourful tide,       6175 
Opportunities for jests and sharp practice? 
 
Faust 
 
Don’t give me that: in the good old days 
You wore us out in a thousand ways: 
And now this wandering, there and here, 
Is only so I can’t catch your ear.      6180 But there’s something I need done: 
Commander and Chamberlain egg me on. 
The Emperor, I must work quickly for him, Wants Helen and Paris to  appear before him: 
He wants to see the ideal form of Man      6185 
Clearly revealed to him, and Woman. Get to work! I daren’t break my word.  
Mephistopheles 
 
Such a thoughtless promise was absurd. 
 
Faust 
 
Friend, you haven’t considered 
Where your powers have lead us:      6190 First we made him rich, and how, 
So he wants us to amuse him now. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
You think it’s fixed that quickly: 
We’re looking at a deeper track, To the strangest realm, and wickedly,      6195 
Adding new faults to the old, 
Do you think it’s easy to call Helen back, 
Like a pasteboard sp irit edged with gold – 
Witch-bitches, ghost-hostesses, freely, 
Or dwarf-maidens, I’ll serve you equally:     6200 
But Devil’s sweethearts, though you’re for them, Still you can’t, as heroines, applaud them.  
Faust 
 
Still the same old story, every day! 
With you, things are always difficult. 
You’re the father of all obstacles,      6205 For every miracle you want more pay. 
I know: a little mutteri ng, and it’s done: 
At a blink, you’ll bring her here. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
With Pagan folk I don’t get on: 
They live in their own Hell there:      6210 
Yet, there is a way.  
Faust 
 
              Tell, without delay! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Unwillingly! There’s a gr eater mystery, I say, 
Goddesses, enthroned on high, and solitary. 
No space round them, not even time: only To speak of them embarrasses me.      6215 
They are The Mothers! 
 Faust (Terrified .) 
 
Mothers! 
 Mephistopheles 
         Are you afraid? 
 
Faust 
 
The Mothers! Mothers! It sounds so strange! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
As, it is. Goddesses, unknown, as you see, 
To you Mortals, not named by us willingly. You must dig in the Depths to reach them:     6220 
It’s your own fault that we need them.  
 
Faust 
 
Where is the path? 
 
Mephistopheles 
         No path! Into the un-enterable, 
Never to be entered: One path to the un-askable, 
Never to be asked. Are you ready? 
No locks, no bolts to manipulate,      6225 You’ll drift about in solitary space. Can you conceive the waste and solitary? 
 
Faust  
I think you might spare the speeches then: 
They always smell of the witches’ kitchen, Of a long forgotten time, to me.       6230 
Have I not trafficked with the world? 
Learned the void, the void unfurled? – When I spoke with reason, as I descried, 
Contradiction, doubl y loud, replied: 
Have I not fled, from hateful trickery,      6235 Into the wild, into the solitary, And, not to lose all, and live alone, 
Surrendered to the Devil’s own? 
 Mephistopheles 
 
And if you’d swum through every ocean, 
And seen the boundless space all round     6240 You’d still have seen wa ve on wave in motion, 
Though you might have been afraid to drown. 
You’d have seen something . Seen, within  
The green still seas, the leaping dolphin: Seen clouds go by, Sun, Moon and star –     6245 
You’ll see none in the endless void, afar, 
Hear not a single footstep fall, Find no firm place to rest at all. 
 
Faust 
 
You speak as chief of all Mystagogues, who 
Deceive their neophytes, the loyal and true:     6250 Only reversed. You send me to the Void, 
So I’ll increase the power and skill employed: 
To use me, like a cat, that’s your desire: Just to claw your chestnuts from the fire. 
The same as ever! I’ll find what I’ll discover:    6255 
In your Nothingness, I hope, the All I will recover. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I’ll praise you, before  you separate from me, 
That you know the Devil, I can truly see: 
Here take this key. 
 
Faust 
                 That tiny thing! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Grasp it, it has a worth you’re undervaluing.     6260  Faust 
 
It’s growing in my hand, it shines and glows! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
What one possesses in it, would you now know? The key will sniff the pl ace out, from all others. 
Follow it down: it leads you to the Mothers. 
 
Faust 
 
The Mothers! That always st rikes me like a blow!    6265 
What is that word that, once heard, scares me so? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Are you so limited one new word disturbs you? 
Will you only hear what you’re accustomed to? 
Don’t be troubled, whatever strange sound rings, You’ve already long been used to marvellous things.   6270 
 
Faust 
 
Yes, there’s no good for me in lethargy. 
A shudder’s the truest sign of humanity: 
Though the world is such we may not feel it, Once seized by it, we feel Immensity deeply.  
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Then, descend! I might as easily say rise!     6275 
It’s all the same. Esca pe from what exists, 
Into the boundless realm where all Form lies! 
Delight in what’s no longer on the list: 
Where turmoil rolls along all cloudily: Then, far from your body, swing the key!     6280   Faust (Inspired .) 
 
Good! I feel new strength, firmly grasped, 
My heart expands, on now  to the great task. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Sight of a glowing tripod will tell you, finally, 
You’re in the last deep, deepest there might be.  
By its light you’ll see the Mothers,      6285 
Some sit about, as they wish, the others, Stand and move. Formation, Transformation, 
Eternal minds in eternal recreation. 
Images of all creature s float, portrayed: 
They’ll not see you: they onl y see a shade.     6290 
Be of good heart, the danger there is great, 
Go to the tripod: don’t hesitate, And touch it with the key! 
 
(Faust assumes a commanding attitude with the key .) 
 
Mephistopheles (Watching him .) 
 
                     That’s right! 
It will close itself, and follow as a servant might: 
Exalted by your good luck, you’ll calmly rise,    6295 
And be back with it, before you’ve blinked your eyes. And, once you’ve brought  it here all right, 
Call the Hero and Heroine from the night, 
The first man who has ever achieved it: It’s done, and you’re the one who did it.     6300 
By magic process then you’ll surely find, 
The incense’ vapour will become divine.   
Faust 
 
And now: what?  Mephistopheles 
 
 Strain with all your being: downward. 
Stamp to descend, stamp again to go upward.  
(Faust stamps and sinks out of sight .) 
 If he might only gain some good from that key!    6305 I’m curious as to whethe r he’ll return to me. Part II Act I Scene VI: Brilliantly Lit Halls 
 
(The Emperor and Princes. The Court in Action .) 
 The Chamberlain (To Mephistopheles ) 
 
You still owe us that scene with the Spirits: The Emperor’s impatient. Get on with it!  
The Steward 
 
That’s what His Grace just now was saying: 
You! Don’t offend His Maje sty by delaying.     6310 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
That’s why my comp anion has just gone: 
He knows how to put the whole thing on, 
And has to labour away in silence: still, 
All the most special diligence he applies: He who’d own that treasure, the Beautiful,     6315 
Needs highest arts, th e magic of the wise. 
 
The Steward 
 
The arts you need are ne ither here nor there: 
The Emperor orders it to be prepared.  
A Blonde Lady  (Approaching Mephistopheles .) 
 Sir, a word! You see a clear complexion, 
Yet it’s not so in summertime’s dejection!     6320 
A hundred red-brown freckles all sprout there, And cover my white skin: I’m in despair. 
A cure! Mephistopheles 
 
        A pity! Such a shining beauty, 
Spotted like a panther-cub, in May! Take frogspawn, toads’ tongue s, in cohabitation,    6325 
Skilfully, under a full moon,  make a distillation, 
When it wanes, apply it undiluted, When spring comes, the spots have been uprooted.  
A Dark-haired Lady 
 
The crowd are pressing round to squeeze you dry. 
I ask a cure! For a frozen foot       6330 
That hinders me in dancing, walking by, And I curtsey awkwardly to boot . 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Permit a little kick from my foot. 
 
The Dark-haired Lady 
 
Well, between lovers th at’s occurred before. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Child! My kick means something more.     6335 Like cures like, when one’s suffering: 
Foot heals foot, and so with every member. 
Come! Pay attention! No retaliation there.  
The Dark-haired Lady  (Crying out .) 
 Ouch! Ouch! That hurt! I call that kicking 
Like a horse’s hoof. Mephistopheles 
 
         With that the cure I bring.      6340 
You can indulge in any amount of dancing, Touch feet under the tabl e with your darling. 
 
A Lady  (Pushing forward .) 
 Let me through! My suffering is so great, 
He used to hold me in his heart’s embrace: 
Yesterday his joy was in my glances,      6345 He turns his back on me: with her romances. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
That’s serious, but listen to me now. 
You must gently press your advances,  Take this charcoa l: mark him anyhow, 
On his cloak or on his sleeve alight,      6350 
He’ll feel sweet Remorse’s blow. Swallow the charcoal straight away, 
No wine or water on your lips all day: 
He’ll be sighing at your door tonight.  
The Lady 
 
It’s not poisonous? 
 
Mephistopheles (Offended .) 
 
        Respect now, where it’s due!    6355 
You’d have to travel far to find such charcoal: 
It comes from the dying pyre at a funeral, On which I, once more, diligently blew. 
 
A Page 
 
I’m in love: they say I’m not old enough to. Mephistopheles (Aside .) 
 
I’m not sure now, whom I should listen to.     6360 
 (To the Page .) 
 
Don’t set your heart on the younger ones. The older will value what they’ve won.  
(Others crowd round .) 
 More, already! What a demanding crew! 
I’ll help myself, and out now with the truth: 
The worst expedient! The pain is great, you see. –    6365 O Mothers, Mothers! Just let Faust go free! 
 
(Gazing round him. ) 
 
The lights burn dim, already, in the hall, 
The Court’s moving off, and they’re all Arranged in their proper rank, I see, 
Through the far aisles and galleries.      6370 
Now they assemble in  the largest place, 
The vast Hall of the Knight s, there’s barely space, 
Who bought the mass of bright tapestry, 
Filled corners, niches like an armoury. 
Here I doubt there’s need of magic spells:     6375 The ghosts will find this place for themselves. Part II Act I Scene VII: The Hall of the Knights, Dimly Lit 
 
(The Emperor and Court .) 
 
The Herald 
 
My ancient duty, to announce the play, 
Is thwarted by the Spirits’ secret action: Please forgive: there’s no sensible way 
To explain such confused transformation.     6380 
The chairs are here: the stools and all: The emperor’s high up, by the wall: 
He can see the battle s on the tapestry 
From mighty ages: watching comfortably. Here they all sit now, Prin ce, Court around,     6385 
Benches packed together, as background:  
In this hour of spirits, too, the lovers Have lovingly found room beside their lovers. 
And now that all have found their proper places, 
We’re ready: let the spirits show their faces!     6390  
(Trumpets .) 
 
The Astrologer 
 
Begin the drama then without delay, 
The Emperor commands: take walls away! No further hindrance, here magic is at hand: 
The Tapestry’s shrivelled as if by burning brand. 
The walls divide, and sweep apart, as one,     6395 
An empty stage it seems has been created, 
A mysterious light falls on our faces, 
And I climb up to the proscenium. Mephistopheles  (Rising to view in the prompter’s box .) 
 
From here I hope for ge neral acclamation, 
Prompting is the devil’s true oration.      6400  
(To the Astrologer .) 
 You know the measures that all the stars obey, You’ll understand my whispers  in a masterly way.  
 
The Astrologer 
 
By miraculous power appears to view, 
A massive temple-front: it’s ancient too. Like Atlas, who once held up the sky,      6405 
The many rows of co lumns stand on high. 
They might well bear the stony weight, Since two could raise a building straight. 
 
The Architect 
 
That’s the antique! It doe sn’t earn my praise, 
Clumsy, overstretched we call it, nowadays.     6410 Men think that crude is noble: bulk is greatness. I love slender shafts , uplifting, boundless: 
A pointed arch sends the spirit to the sky: 
Architecture such as that will edify.  
The Astrologer 
 
Receive with reverence these h ours the stars allow:    6415 
Let words of magic bind pure Reason now: 
Let marvellously daring Fantasy, In return, sweep onward, wide and free. 
Your eyes see what you daringly conceived: 
It’s impossible, so more worthy to be believed.    6420  (Faust rises into view on the other side of the proscenium .) In priestly vestments, crowned, a wondrous man, 
Fulfilling what he confidently began. 
A tripod rises with him from deep abyss, 
I smell the odour of incense in the dish. He prepares to bless this sacred labour:     6425 
From this moment on it will find favour. 
 Faust (Sublimely .) 
 
In your name, Mothers, you enthroned 
In boundlessness, set eternally alone, And yet together. All the Forms of Life 
Float round your heads, active, not alive.     6430 
Whatever was, in all its glow and gleam, 
Moves there still, since it must always be. 
And you assign it, with omnipotent might, 
To day’s pavilion or the vault of night. Life holds some fast on its sweet track,     6435 
Others the bold magician must bring back: 
Filled with faith, and richly generous, He shows, what each desires, the Marvellous. 
 
The Astrologer 
 
The glowing key has scarcely touched the dish, 
At once the room is filled with darkened mist:    6440 
It swirls about, as puffs of cloud will do, Grows, condenses, shrinks, and splits in two. 
And now behold a spirit-masterpiece! 
As it moves about, there’s music without cease. In heavenly tones, pours out a who-knows-how,    6445 
And while it moves, all’s turned to melody now. 
The pillared shafts, even the tri-glyph, ringing I think that the whole temple’s singing. 
The dark sinks down: from the light mist, 
A handsome youth steps out in time to it.     6450 I needn’t name him, so my task is finished, Who doesn’t know the name of charming Paris! A Lady 
 
O! What a shining h ealthy powerful youth! 
 
A Second 
 
Like a peach, so fresh and full of juice! 
 
A Third 
 
The finely delineated, sweetly swelling lip!     6455 
 
A Fourth 
 
From such a cup you’d surely like to sip? 
 
A Fifth 
 
He’s quite pretty, but a little unrefined. 
 
A Sixth 
 
He could be a bit more graceful, to my mind.  
A Knight 
 
I sense the shepherd here, I think, 
No trace of Courtier or Prince.       6460 
 
Another  
 
Yes! Half naked the youth’s quite handsome 
We’d need to see him first with armour on!  
A Lady 
 
He sits down so gently and pleasantly. A Knight 
 
You’d like to sit on his lap, comfortably? 
 
Another 
 
He lifts his arm so lightly above his head.     6465 
 
A Chamberlain 
 
The lout! That’s not acceptable: how ill-bred! 
 
A Lady 
 
You lords find fault with everything. 
 
The Chamberlain  
In the Emperor’s presence, all that stretching! 
 
The Lady 
 
He’s posed there! He thinks he’s quite alone.  
 
The Chamberlain 
 
Even a play should be polite in tone.      6470 
 
The Lady 
 
Now sleep has overcome the charming boy. 
 
The Chamberlain  
And now he’ll snore: that’s natural, what joy! A Young Lady 
 
What refreshes my heart so  deeply, that fragrance 
Mixed with fumes from the burning incense?   
 
An Older Lady 
 
Truly! It’s breath penetrates one’s nature,     6475 
It comes from him! 
 
An Elderly lady 
 
      It’s the sap of nurture, 
It’s generated in youth, like ambrosia, And spreads around in the atmosphere. 
 
(Helen emerges .) 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
So that’s her!  I’d not lose sleep for that. She 
Is quite pretty, true, but doe sn’t do much for me.    6480 
 
The Astrologer  
There’s nothing more now for me to do, 
As men of honour confe ss, I confess it too. 
Beauty comes: if only I’d a tongue of fire! – 
Beauty so many songs has forever inspired – 
Whom she appears to, of self he’s dispossessed,    6485 Whom she belonged to, was too greatly blessed. 
 
Faust  
Is this the fount of b eauty? Have I still, eyes? 
What pours here, through my mind, so richly? My dreadful journey yields a blessed prize. How void the world was, undeveloped for me!    6490 
What is it now since my priesthood? 
Desirable, lasting, solid underfoot! The power of my life’s breath should 
Fail, if I’m ever again estranged from you! – 
The perfect form that drew me before,      6495 
Delighting me, in the magic mirror, Was only an airy phantom of such beauty! – You 
Are the true embodiment of my passion:  
Towards you is my powers’ whole direction To you, love, feeling, faith , madness are owed.    6500 
 
Mephistopheles (From the prompter’s box .) 
 Calm yourself, now, and don’t fail in your role! 
 
An Older Lady 
 
Tall, well formed, only the head is small. 
 
A Younger Lady 
 
Just look! Could clumsier feet exist at all? 
 
A Diplomat 
 
I’ve seen princesses of this kind: though 
I think she’s beautiful, from head to toe.     6505 
 
A Courtier 
 
Soft and sly, she goes towards the sleeper. 
 
A Lady  
 
How ugly, near that form so young and pure.      
 
A Poet 
 
From her Beauty shines towards him. A Lady 
 
A picture! Luna and Endymion! 
 
The Poet 
 
Quite so! The goddess seems to descend,     6510 
Leans above him to dri nk his breath, ah then: 
Enviable! – A Kiss! – The cup’s full to excess. 
 
A Duenna 
 
In front of everyone! What utter madness! 
 
Faust 
 
A dreadful favour to grant a boy! – 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
              Quiet now! Be still! 
And let the spectre do what it will.      6515 
 
A Courtier 
 
She slips away, lightly: he awakes. 
 
A Lady 
 
Just as I thought! That glance she takes! 
 
A Courtier 
 
He stares! It’s wonderful what’s happening. 
 
A Lady 
 
But not so wonderful what  she sees in him. 
 A Courtier 
 
She turns towards him now with dignity.     6520  
 
A Lady 
 
I see she’ll soon take him through his lesson: 
At such times men behave quite stupidly, Perhaps he even thinks that’s he the first one. 
 
A Knight 
 
Let me be worthy! Ma jestically fine! – 
 
A Lady 
 
The trollop! I’d call that table wine!      6525 
 
A Page 
 
I’d like to swap his place for mine! 
 
A Courtier 
 
Who wouldn’t be tangled in such a net? 
 
A Lady 
 
That treasure’s been handled often, you forget, 
And the gilding’s mostly rubbed away. 
 
Another 
 
Worthless since it was ten years old, I’d say.     6530 
 
A Knight 
 
Sometimes one takes the best that one can get: 
I’d be content with the loveliness that’s left. 
 A Learned Man 
 
I see clearly but I’ll confess, quite freely, 
It’s doubtful if that’s the true one I see. The Present’s tempted to exaggerate,      6535 
I hold to what the ancient texts relate. 
There I read she gave particular joy To all the grey-bearded men of Troy: And that fits perfectly here too, you see: 
I’m not young: still she gives joy to me.     6540 
 
The Astrologer 
 
No longer a boy! A daring hero, he: 
Grasped she defends herself, but barely. 
He lifts her high in his strong arms, too, 
Will he carry her off?  
Faust 
            Audacious fool! 
You dare? Do you hear? Stop! Enough, I say!    6545 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
You created the mime these phantoms play! 
 
The Astrologer 
 
A word! After what we’ve been given, 
I’ll call this piece: The Rape of Helen . 
 
Faust 
 
What rape! Am I nothing in this place! 
Is this key no longer in my hand!      6550 
It led me through te rror, waste and wave, 
Through solitude, to wher e, set firm, I stand.  
Here’s a foothold! Here’s reality, 
Where spirit dare with spirits disagree, 
And prepare itself for its great, dual mastery.     6555 She was so far: how could she closer shine! 
I’ll rescue her, and she’ll be doubly mine. 
The risk! The Mothers! They must grant her! 
Who knows her once, can never live without her. 
 
The Astrologer 
 
What are you doing, Faust! Faust! –With force    6560 
He seizes her, the form dims in its course. 
He turns the key against the youth, and then, 
Touches him! – Ah! – G one, in a moment! Gone! 
 
(An explosion. Faust falls to the gr ound. The spirits vanish in mist .) 
 Mephistopheles (Taking Faust on his shoulders .) 
 
You’ve done it now! Carry ing fools, my friend, 
Brings harm to the Devil himself, in the end.     6565 
 
(Darkness. Tumult .) Part II Act II Scene I: A High-A rched, Narrow, Gothic Chamber  
Formerly Faust’s, Unchanged 
 
Mephistopheles (Entering from behind a curtain. As he holds it up and 
looks behind him, Faust is seen lyi ng stretched out on an antiquated bed .)  
 
Lie there, unlucky man! One tempted by The bonds of a love not readily undone! The man whom Helena  shall paralyse 
Won’t find it easy to regain his reason. 
 (Looking around him .) 
 
I look upwards, here, around me,      6570 All’s unaltered, and undamaged: 
Stained glass, there, shows darkly, 
Spiders have added to their webs: The ink is dry: the paper’s yellow, 
But everything’s still in its place:      6575 
Even the quill-pen’s here, on show, With which Faust and the Devil embraced. 
Yes! Deeper in the nib there’s still 
A drop of blood, I tempted him to spill. It’s a unique piece, in my book,       6580 So I’ll wish the great collectors luck. 
The old fur-robe, on the hook, too, 
Reminds me of a joke or two, That time when I taught the student, 
What, perhaps, in youth, he’s glad he learnt.     6585 
Truly the same desire is on me, for You, smoke-singed gown: you and I, 
To flaunt ourselves once more as a professor, 
And speak as one who’s always in the right. How to achieve that all the learned know:      6590 
It’s something the Devil lost long ago. 
 (He shakes the fur as he takes it dow n, and moths, crickets and beetles fly 
out.) 
 Chorus of Insects 
 
Greetings! We’re greeting 
Our Patron of old, We’re floating and buzzing, 
To us you’re well known.       6595 
Singly, in silence, You sowed us like plants. Father, in thousands  
We’ve come to the dance. 
The jester is snugly        6600 Contained in the breast, 
The lice in the fur they 
Are sooner expressed.  
Mephistopheles 
 
What a nice surprise, this young brood of mine! 
One merely sows, and harves ts in due time.     6605 
I’ll shake this ancient fleece about, Here and there, one flutters out. – 
Away! Around! In a hundred leavings, 
Hurry and hide yourself, you darlings. There, where the ancient boxes lie,      6610 Here, in the smoky parchment try, 
In that broken dusty old pottery, 
Or the skull, its eye-sockets empty. All this jumbled mildewed existence, 
Always gives one whims and fancies.      6615 
Again let’s dress up as a lecturer! Today I’ll be the Principal, once more. 
But it’s no use naming myself, you see:  
Where are the people,  to welcome me? Famulus (A College Servant, tottering here, down the long gallery ) 
 
What a noise! What a quake!       6620 
The stairs sway, the walls shake: Through the windows’ trembling colours 
I see the lightning gleam above us. 
The floor leaps, and, on high, Plaster, rubble from the sky.       6625 And the door, once tightly locked, 
By wondrous force is thrown back. – 
There! How fearful! A giant Look, in Faust’s old garment! 
At his gazing, and his pleas,       6630 
I want to sink to my knees. Shall I go? Shall I remain? 
Oh, what will happen to me, then! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Here, my friend! – You ’re called Nicodemus. 
 
Famulus 
 
Honoured Sir! That’s my name – Oremus .     6635 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Enough of that!  
 
Famulus  
      How pleased I am you knew me! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I know you well: a student still, I see, Mossy Sir! After all, a learned man Studies hard, and does the best he can. 
So one builds a respectable house of cards,     6640 
That greater minds can’t finish afterwards. But he’s a witty fellow, is your master, 
Who doesn’t know the noble Doctor Wagner? 
He’s the first in all the world of learning! 
He’s unique: wisdom, each day increasing, And all of it he still holds together,       6645 
Crowds, around him, panting, gather 
Listeners, eaves’-droppers, welcome. Alone, he shines there at the rostrum. He holds a key, just like Saint Peter,      6650 
That unlocks the lower, and the higher. 
He glows and sparkles above the rest, No name and fame has wider standing: 
Even that of Faust has dimmed, at best: 
He’s the one who’s always inventing.       6655 
 
Famulus 
 
Forgive me, honoured Sir, if I dare 
To speak, and contradict you, there: 
There’s no question of that, I must declare: Since modesty’s his role, as all discern. 
Discovering nothing of the circumstances,     6660 
Baffled by the great man’s disappearance: He seeks all health and comfort in his return. 
The room waits for its old master 
While Doctor Faustus is away, 
Untouched, still, as in his day.       6665 And I scarcely dare to enter. 
What can the stars be doing? – 
The walls themselves are frightening me: The doorframes quiver, bolts work free, 
Or you yourself couldn’t have got in.      6670 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
And your great man where is he? 
Lead me there: or bring him here to me! Famulus 
 
Oh! His warnings are quite clear, 
I’m not allowed to interfere. For months I’ve left him in utter peace,     6675 
Till his great work is complete. 
He, the most delicate of scholars, His face looks like a charcoal burner’s, Blackened now from nose to ears, 
Eyes crimson, blowing up the fires,      6680 
All the while, so enthusiastic: Clinking of tongs, that’s his music. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Why would he deny an entrance to me? 
I’m one who’d speed his luck, you see.  
(The Famulus exits: Mephistopheles sits down, gravely .) 
 I’ve hardly taken my seat here,       6685 
And I see a guest behind my chair. 
But he’s one of the new school’s persuasion: He’ll be arrogant, I think, on this occasion.  
Baccalaureus  (Storming along the corridor .) 
 I find the gates and doors are open! 
Now there’s room at last for hope then,     6690 
That it won’t be merely as before,  A live man, acting as a corpse, 
Wasting away, and rotting, 
Till he merely dies of living.  
These walls and these partitions,      6695 
Bow and sink towards perdition, And if we don’t look about us, Their decline and fall will rout us. 
I’m audacious, no one more so, 
But no further in do I go.        6700  
What will I find here today? 
It’s years since I’ve been this way, 
Where timid and innocent As a freshman I was sent! 
Where I trusted in my elders,       6705 
Edified by all their blather.  From the dry old books, they knew 
They lied to me: what they knew, 
Not believing in it truly, Stealing life itself, from me.       6710 
What? – There, in his cell, 
Sits a darkly bright one still!  
With astonishment now, nearer, 
See him sitting in his dark fur, Truly, as I left him sitting        6715 
Still in all his coarse wrapping! 
Then he seemed a fount of wisdom, Since I didn’t understand him. 
He won’t find me so today, 
Fresh and new, I’m on my way!       6720  Sir, if in Lethe’s melancholy stream 
That bald nodding head’s not swum, 
See your grateful scholar come, Outgrown, his academic dream. 
I find you now, as I saw you:       6725 
I was another though: that’s true.  
Mephistopheles 
 
I’m glad the ringing brought you. 
I rated you once before as high: 
The caterpillar, the chrysalis too, Showed the bright future butterfly.      6730 Your curly hair and pointed collar, 
Made you a childishly pleasing scholar.  
You never wore pigtails I believe? – And today you’re cropped like a Swede. 
I see you’re bold and resolute:       6735 
But don’t go home too absolute! 
 
Baccalaureus 
 
My old master! We’re in our old places: 
But don’t think to renew time’s journey, And spare me words with dual-faces: 
I treat them now quite differently.      6740 
You teased the true, and honest youth. It wasn’t difficult for you to do 
It’s what no one dares to do today. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Pure truth on the young is thrown away, 
The little beaks don’t like it, any way,      6745 
But afterwards when years have passed, 
And they’ve learnt it for themselves at last, And think it came from them, not school: 
Then we hear: ‘The Master was a fool.’ 
 
Baccalaureus 
 
A rascal, maybe! – What teac her ever shows us    6750 
The Truth directly, underneath our noses? They know the way to make  it seem more, or less, 
Now serious, now playful, as suits the children best. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
There’s a moment given us for learning, truly: 
But you’re ready now to teach, yourself, I see.    6755 
For many moons, united with their suns, 
You the riches of experience have won. Baccalaureus 
 
Experience! Mist and Foam! 
And not the Spirit’s equal. Confess! What one has known,       6760 
Is not worth knowing at all. 
 Mephistopheles (After a pause .) 
 
I’ve thought so for ages. I was a Fool, 
But I think that shallow now I’m sensible.  
Baccalaureus 
 
That pleases me! I hear pure Reason’s sound: 
The first old man of sense I’ve ever found.       6765 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I sought for treasure, buried gold, 
And brought to light frightful coals . 
 
Baccalaureus  
Confess now, your skull, bald and old, 
Is worth no more than that empty poll. 
 Mephistopheles (Amiably .) 
 
Do you know, my friend, how rude you seem to me?   6770 
 
Baccalaureus 
 
In German, one’s lying if one speaks politely. Mephistopheles  (Wheeling his chair nearer to the proscenium and the 
audience .) 
 
Up here I’m dazed by light and air: 
Shall I take shelter with you down there? 
 
Baccalaureus 
 
I find it arrogant that in times like these, 
A man wants to be what he no longer is.     6775 
Man’s life is in his arteries, and when Are they so vibrant as in younger men? 
There the fresh blood full of strength 
Creates new life from its own life again. There all works, and things get done,      6780 
The waverers fall, the capable get on. 
While we’ve conquered half the world, What have you done? Nodded, curled 
In the sun, dreamed, weighed, plan on plan. 
For sure, age is a chilling fever:       6785 The frost of whims and need ahead. 
When your thirtieth year is over, 
A man’s as good as dead. It would be best to seek an early grave.  
Mephistopheles 
 
That leaves the Devil nothing more to say.     6790 
 
Baccalaureus 
 
Unless I will it, no Devil can exist. 
 
Mephistopheles (Aside .) 
 
The Devil will still trip you, in a bit.  
Baccalaureus 
 
This is youth’s noblest profession! The world was nothing before my creation: 
I drew the Sun out of the sea:       6795 
The Moon began her change ful course with me: 
The daylight decked my  path to greet me, 
The Earth flowered, grew  green, to meet me. 
At my command, in primal night, 
The stars in splendour swam to sight.      6800 Who, but I, loosed from its prison Cramped thought’s philistinism? 
I, quite free, as my spirit cites, 
Happily following my inner light, And speeding on, in delight,       6805 
Darkness behind: and a ll before me, bright. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Go forth in splendour, you primal man! – 
How could insight harm you, ever: 
Who can think of stupid things or clever, 
That past ages didn’t, l ong ago, understand.     6810 
Yet there’s no danger from him, you see, 
He’ll think about it differently in time: 
Even if the grape-ju ice acts absurdly, 
In the end it changes into wine.  
(To the younger members of th e audience, who do not applaud .) 
 My words have left you cold, I gather, 
May it be so for you, sweet children: 
But think: the Devil’s a lot older, So you need to be old to understand him! Part II Act II Scene II: A Laboratory 
 
(In the fashion of the Middle Ages: lots of heavy apparatus for strange 
purposes .) 
 
Wagner  (At the furnace .) 
 The fearful bell is sounding, The soot-black walls shudder.       6820 
My deepest expectation 
Will be unsure no longer. Soon the dark itself will lighten: 
Soon in the innermost phial, 
It will glow like living fire,       6825 Yes, like the noblest ruby’s glow, 
Lightning flashing in the shadow. 
A clearest white li ght shines now! 
Ah, not to lose it once more! – 
Oh, God! Who’s rattling at the door?      6830 
 
Mephistopheles (Entering .) 
 
Greetings! And kindly meant now. 
 
Wagner (Anxiously .) 
 
Welcome, to the planet of the hour!  
(Whispering .) 
 
But stifle your breath, and words’ power, 
A noble work is likewise being weighed. 
 Mephistopheles (Whispering .) 
 
What might it be?  Wagner (Whispering .) 
    
A Man is being made.     6835  
Mephistopheles 
 
A Man? And what loving couple 
Have you got hidden, up the chimney? 
 
Wagner 
 
God Forbid! How unfashionable! 
We’re free of all that idle foolery. 
The tender moment from whic h life emerged,    6840 
The charming power with which its inner urge, 
Took and gave, and clea rly stamped its seal, 
First in a near, and then a further field, We now divest of all that dignity: 
Though the creatures still enjoy it, we,      6845 
As Men, with all our greater gifts, begin, To have, as we should, a nobler origin. 
 
(He turns towards the furnace .) 
 
It brightens! See! –  No w there’s a real chance, 
That, if from the hundred-fold substance, By mixing – since mixing makes it happen –     6850 The stuff of human life’s compounded, 
And distilled in a flask, well-founded, 
And in proper combination, grounded, Then the silent work is done. 
 
(He turns again to the furnace .) 
 
It will be! The mass is clearer!       6855 
The proof comes nearer, nearer: What man praises in deepest Nature, 
Through Reason we dare to probe it, 
And what she organises, here, We’re now able to crystallise it.       6860  Mephistopheles 
 
Who lives a while, gain s much experience, 
And nothing new can ha ppen on his journey. 
In years of travelling, and in my presence,  
I’ve seen, already, cr ystallised humanity.  
 Wagner (Up till now attending to the phial .) 
 
It rises: flashes, there’s expansion      6865 
In a moment more it will be done. Great aims seem foolish at the outset: 
But we’ll laugh at Chance itself, yet, 
And brains, with thoughts to celebrate, In the future, a Thinker will create.      6870 
 
(He inspects the phial, rapturously .) 
 
The glass rings with sweet power, 
It darkens, clears: it must have being! In a delicate form I see appear 
A well-behaved little Man behaving. 
What can the world ask more, what can we?     6875 Now that this mystery’s visible to each. Give ear to what these sounds may be, 
They make a voice: they’re forming speech. 
 Homunculus (From the phial, to Wagner .) 
 
Now, father! That was no joke. How are you? Come: press me tenderly to your heart, too!     6880 
But not too hard, the glass may be too thin. 
It’s in the very nature of the thing: For the natural the world has barely space: 
What’s artificial commands a narrow place. 
 (To Mephistopheles .) 
 
But you, Rascal, my dear Cousin, are you     6885 
Here at the right moment? I thank you, too. Good fortune’s led you here to me: 
Since I exist, I must be doing, you see. 
I’d like to begin my work today: 
You’re skilful at shortening the way.      6890  
Wagner 
 
But first, a word! Till now I’ve had no direction, 
When old or young teased me with a question. 
For example: no one’s found out, ever, 
What makes body and soul fit together: Stick tight, as if there’ll be no separation,     6895 
Yet always cause each other irritation. 
So then, -  
Mephistopheles 
 
          Stop! I’d rather he told me,  
Why married people get by so wretchedly? 
You’ll never discover that, my friend. 
There’s work to do the little Man can tend.     6900 
 
Homunculus 
 
What work’s to do?  
 
Mephistopheles (Pointing to a side door .) 
 
  Employ your gifts on this! 
 Wagner  (Still gazing at the phial .) 
 
Truly, you’re the loveliest boy there is!  
(The side-door opens: Faust is seen stretched out on a couch .) Homunculus (Astonished .) 
 
Interesting! 
 (The phial slips out of Wagner’s hands, hovers over Faust, and shines on 
him.) 
  Lovely surroundings! – Clear water In thick forest! Women there: undressing. 
The loveliest of all! – It’s getting clearer.     6905 
One’s left, different from the rest, gleaming: Of highest race, for sure, a heavenly name. 
She places her foot in the transparent glow, 
Her noble body’s sweetly living flame Cools itself in the yielding crystal flow. –     6910 
But what’s that rush of beating wings for: 
That thrashing, splashing, in the mirror? The lovely girls, intimidated, flee: 
Their queen, alone, looks on, composedly, 
To see, with a proud feminine pleasure,      6915 The Swan-Prince press against her knee, there, 
Forward yet tame. Familiar, he seems. – 
But suddenly a vapour heaves, And covers, with the veil it weaves, The loveliest of scenes.        6920 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
All the things that you could murmur! 
So little: and such a great dreamer. I see nothing – 
 
Homunculus 
 
            So I believe. You’re Northern, 
In the age of mist you’re born then,      6925 In a jumble of priest-craft and chivalry, So how could your sight be free! 
You’re at home with darkness. 
 (He gazes around .) 
 
Brown repulsive, mildewed walls, 
Low, pointed arches, full of scrolls! – One wakes, and gives another pain,      6930 
On the spot, dead then, he’ll remain. 
Wooded founts, swans, naked beauty, That was his far-sighted dream: How could this place do duty! 
I can scarcely endure the scene.       6935 
Carry him off!  
Mephistopheles 
 
    I’d be happy: a last chance. 
 
Homunculus 
 
Order the soldier to the fight, 
Lead the maiden to the dance, 
Then everything’s done right. 
Even now, thinks, quick as light,      6940 
It’s Classical Walpurgis Night: That’s the best, if he were sent To his own true element! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I’ve never heard that event named, here. 
 
Homunculus 
 
How could it come to your ear?       6945 Only Romantic ghosts, for you: 
A true ghost must be Classic too. Mephistopheles 
 
Which path do we take there? Already 
Your antique collea gues quite repel me. 
 
Homunculus 
 
North-westward Satan, is your pleasure ground,    6950 
But this time we’re South-eastward bound – 
In wider space flows Peneus, the free 
By bushes, groves, and damp still bays: Its levels stretch to mountain ways, 
And over it Pharsalus: old, yet contemporary.    6955 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Oh! Enough! And keep all the fight, 
Of tyranny and slavery, out of sight. 
It bores me: they’re scarce done when 
They start the whole thing over again: 
And no one sees: they’re be ing re-aligned,     6960 
By Asmodeus, who works them from behind. 
They clash, it’s said , for Freedom’s right: 
Seen rightly, slave with slave is all the fight. 
 
Homunculus 
 
Leave Mankind’s wilfulness to me, then. 
Each man defends himself, as best he can,     6965 
From childhood, till, at last, he is a man. 
Just ask how we can get back there again. 
Have you a method, then, let’s see: 
If you haven’t, leave it all to me.  
Mephistopheles 
 
There’s many a Brocken trick I could display,    6970 
But I find that Pagan bolts  have barred the way. 
The whole Greek race was never that much use! 
They dazzle with the senses’ freer play: it’s true: They lure the heart of man to happier sins: 
While ours, one always finds, are gloomy things.    6975 
And now, what? 
 
Homunculus 
 
         Once you weren’t so witless: 
When I spoke about Thessalian witches. 
I can deliver what I said: just think a little. 
 
Mephistopheles (Lustfully .) 
 
Thessalian witches! G ood! They’re the people 
I once enquired about long ago.       6980 I don’t think it would suit me, at all, 
To live with them night after night, though, 
Still, a visit, and a trial –  
Homunculus 
     
      This mantle here, 
Fold it around your knight there!      6985 
As before, the cloak can carry another, One of you, along with the other. I’ll light the way. 
 
Wagner (Anxiously .) 
 
And I? 
 
Homunculus 
 
       Well, now, you 
Stay home, there are im portant things to do. 
Unfold all your ancient parchments, 
Then, by rote, collect life’s elements,      6990 And place them together with due care, Consider What , more deeply consider How . 
Meanwhile round the world, a bit, I’ll fare, 
And find the last dot on the ‘ i’, for now. Then the great work will see its final stage:     6995 
Great effort will merit great reward, you’ll see: 
Gold, honour, fame, a long and ripe old age, 
And science too – and virtue, possibly. Farewell!  
 
Wagner  (Sadly .) 
         Farewell! It gives me pain. 
Already, I fear, I’ll not see you again.      7000 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Now to Peneus, lively, on! 
Sir Cousin’s highly rated.  
 
(To the audience .) 
 
In the end we’re dependent on 
The creatures we’ve created. Part II Act II Scene III: Classical Walpurgis Night.  
The Pharsalian Fields. 
 
(Darkness .) 
 
Erichtho  (The Thessalian Witch, see Lucan’s Pharsalia ) 
 This night’s awesome feast, as so often in the past,    7005 
I enter now, I, Erichtho, the gloomy one: 
Not so abominable as the wretched poets 
Painted me, with excessi ve slander…they never 
Cease their blame or praise …I see the valley whiten 
With waves of tents that gleam greyer in the distance,   7010 
The after-image of that anxious, fearful night. How often it’s repeated! In eternity 
Acted out, again, forever… No one gives the realm 
To another: to the one whose power won it: Whose strength rules. Since each , incapable of ruling   7015 
His inner self, would gladly rule his neighbour’s will, 
In the manner that his proud mind dictates to him… But here a great instance wa s fought out, to the end, 
Of how force may battle against a greater force, 
Freedom’s lovely thousand-blos somed garland be torn,   7020 
And stubborn laurel be w ound round the ruler’s brow. 
Here, Pompey dreams of his youth and former greatness, 
There, Caesar, listening, watches the balance tremble! 
It settles, and the world know s whom it sinks towards. 
The watch fires, glowing, send out their crimson flames:   7025 
The field exhales those images of squandered blood, 
And lured by the strange wondr ous splendour of the night, 
A legion of Hellenic le gends gather here. 
They hover around all the fires uncertainly, 
Or sit nearby, the fabled form s of ancient days….    7030 
The Moon, not full it is true, but of clearest light, 
Rises, scattering mild radiance everywhere: 
The ghostly tents vanish: the fires burn bluish now. But, over my head, what  sudden meteor’s this? 
It shines, illuminates the material globe.     7035 
I smell Life. It’s not fitting for me to approach 
Closer to the living, since I’m harmful to them: It gives me a bad name, and is no benefit to me. 
It sinks down already. I give way, thoughtfully! 
 
(She Exits. The Airy Travellers speak from above .) 
 
Homunculus 
 
Once again float round the circle      7040 Over flames and shuddering horror: 
On the ground, and in the vale still, 
It’s quite ghostly, we discover.  
Mephistopheles 
 
It’s the same as through my old window 
In the grim and tangled north,       7045 
Really loathsome ghosts below, I’m at home here: and there, of course. 
 
Homunculus 
 
See! There’s a tall one striding, 
With gigantic steps, before us. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
As if she were afraid, now: gliding      7050 
Through the air above, she saw us.  
 
Homunculus 
 
Let her stride! Right away, 
Set the knight down there: He’ll return to life again, 
Once he breathes this mythic air.      7055 Faust  (As he touches the ground .) 
 
Where is she? 
 
Homunculus 
 
        We can’t say, I fear, 
But you can probably enquire here. Hurry now before it’s daylight, 
Go and search, from fire to fire: 
Who found his way to the Mothers’ side,     7060 Won’t find this harder to survive. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
On my own behalf too, I’m here: 
But I don’t know anything better Than each to seek, among the fires, 
The adventure he desires.        7065 
Then, so that we can reunite, Little one, shine your ringing light. 
 
Homunculus 
 
It shines like this, and rings. 
 
(The glass shines and rings out powerfully .) 
 
Now off to new and wondrous things! 
 Faust  (Alone .) 
 
Where is she? – But no further answer seek…    7070 If this is not the soil she trod, 
Nor the wave that bathed her foot, 
It is the air that spoke her speech. Here! By a miracle, on Hellenic land! I feel, the earth, too, where I stand:      7075 
A fresh power glows in me, the Sleeper, 
So I am Antaeus-like in nature. And I find the strangest things lie here, 
First let me search this Labyrinth of fire. 
 
(He moves away .) (On the Upper Peneus ) 
 
Mephistopheles  (Looking around .) 
 And as I wander through these fires,      7080 
I feel myself a total stranger: in the event, 
They’re mostly naked, a shirt here and there: 
The Sphinx shameless, the Gryphon impudent: And what’s more, curly-haired and winged, 
Before, behind, in eyes, reflected things…     7085 
Of course, at heart, indecency’s my ideal, But I find the Antique is a little too real. 
One should control all with a modern mind, 
Overlay it with fashions of assorted kinds…. Repulsive people! Yet still I ha ve to meet them,    7090 
And, as a new guest too, correctly greet them… 
Luck to you, fair ladies, a nd men, you wise grey ones!  
 
A Gryphon  (Snarling . For the gold-guarding Gr yphons see Herodotus’ 
Histories. ) 
 
Not Grey ones! Gryphons! – No one likes the name 
Of something grey. Every word rings With what conditioned it: its origins:      7095 Grey, grievous, grumpy, gruesome, gravely, grimly, 
Similarly harmonious etymologically, 
Disharmonise us.  
Mephistopheles 
 
         And yet, without  deviation, 
You like the gryp in your proud name of Gryphon. 
 The Gryphon (Snarling continuously .) 
 
Naturally! The relationship’s tried and tested:    7100 
It was often censured, but  more often praised: 
One grips  maidens, money, gold, 
To the gripper, Fortune’s never cold. Giant Ants 
 
You spoke of gold: we’ve collected lots of it, 
In rocks and caves, secretly , we’ve crammed it:     7105 
The Arimaspi, discover ed it all, one day, 
They’re laughing now: they took it far away. 
 
The Gryphon 
 
We’ll soon make them confess. 
 The Arimaspi  (For the Scythian race of the Arimaspi and their association 
with gold mining see Herodotus’ Histories ) 
 But not on this night of public festival. 
By morning we’ll have spent it all.      7110 
This time at least we’ll achieve success.  
Mephistopheles (Sitting among the Sphinxes .) 
 How free, and easy, I feel here, 
I understand you, one and all. 
 
Sphinx 
 
We breathe out spirit-tones, clear, 
That for you become substantial.      7115 Now name yourself, so we can know your fame. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Men choose to saddle me with a host of names… 
Are there Britons here? They  travel about so much, 
Looking for battlefields, and ruined walls, 
The dullest classical places, waterfalls:     7120 
Here’s a site that’s worth all their fuss. They spoke of me too: in their Mysteries: And portrayed me there as Old Iniquity. A Sphinx 
 
How so? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I don’t know why that should be. 
 
A Sphinx 
 
Perhaps you’ve knowledge of the stars?     7125 
What do you think of the present hour? 
 
Mephistopheles (Gazing upwards .) 
 
Star glides by star, the horned moon shines bright, 
And I feel happy here, in this mournful site, I warm myself on a lion skin: your right. 
To have to take off, again:  that would be hard:    7130 
Give us a riddle, or at least charades.   
Sphinx 
 
To express yourself, that would be a riddle. 
Try for once to  solve your own inner muddle: 
‘Needed by the good man and the sinful, 
To the first a breastplate in ascetic swordplay,    7135 A wild friend for the other, to show the way, 
And both amusing Zeus with their display.’ 
 
The First Gryphon (Snarling .) 
 
I don’t like him!  
The Second Gryphon  (Snarling more fiercely .) 
      What’s he after?  
Both Gryphons 
 The nasty thing, he’s not  been heard of here! 
 
Mephistopheles (Nastily ) 
 Perhaps you think a guest’s nails can’t claw     7140 
Every bit as sharply as those talons of yours? 
Just try it, then!  A Sphinx (Gently .) 
 
             You’ll only stay until, 
You leave our company, yourself, as you will : 
In your own land everything worked for you, 
But this if I’m not wrong’s too much for you.    7145  
Mephistopheles 
 
Looked at above, you’re rather appetising, 
But lower down the creature’ s somewhat frightening. 
 
A Sphinx 
 
False one, you’ll do bitter penance, 
These claws of ours are sound and good: You with your withered horse’s hoof,      7150 
Aren’t comfortable in our presence. 
 (The Sirens start to sing, above them .) 
 
What are those birds shaking The poplar branches by the stream? 
 
A Sphinx 
 
Take care! The song they’re making 
Conquered the best there’s ever been.      7155 The Sirens 
 
Ah, why should you choose to live 
Amongst  amazing ugliness! 
Listen, we flock to you, ah yes, 
With tuneful sounds, in excess, 
That Sirens ought to give.       7160  The Sphinxes  (Mocking them .) 
 
Make them fly down here to us! Their falcon-claws, so hideous, 
They’ve hidden in the leaves: 
They’ll fall on you, cruelly, you see If you choose to hear them sigh.      7165 
 
The Sirens 
 
Away with hate! Away with envy! 
We gather purest ecstasies, Scattered through the sky! 
On the earth, or on the sea, 
With the happiest gestures, we       7170 Greet men who wander by.   
Mephistopheles 
 
This is news of the sweetest, 
Here from lyre and chest, 
One note twines round another. But this warbling’s lost on me:       7175 
It crawls into my ear, you see, 
Yet my heart feels nothing, here.  
The Sphinxes 
 
Don’t talk of hearts! That’s idle: 
A leather bag would do as well, 
To match that face you wear.       7180 
 Faust  (Approaching .) 
 
Marvellous! Gazing’s enough for me, 
At grand repulsiveness, and solidity: I suspect I’ll find good fortune shortly: 
Where will this serious gazing take me? 
 (He points at the Sphinxes .) 
 
Once Oedipus stood in front of them:      7185 
 (He points at the Sirens .) 
 
Ulysses writhed in ropes for them:  
(He points to the Ants .) 
 They gathered a mighty treasure. 
 
(He points to the Gryphons .) 
 
They guarded it in fullest measure. 
I feel new power flowing through me: Mighty these forms: of mighty memory.     7190  
Mephistopheles 
 
Once you’d have run from things like these, 
But now they look good to you: 
When a man seeks his beloved, he’s Ready to meet monsters too. 
 
Faust (To the Sphinxes .) 
 
You female forms, tell me then,       7195 
Have any of you seen Helen? The Sphinxes 
 
None of us lasted till her day, 
Hercules the last did slay. You can ask Chiron, anyway: 
He gallops round in this spirit night:      7200 
When he stops for you, you might.  
The Sirens 
 
You will not fail at all!… 
How Ulysses lingered with us, 
Not hurrying scornfully by us, 
He’d many times recall:        7205 All will be shown you, 
If you make your journey to  
Our fields, in the green sea.  
A Sphinx 
 
Don’t let yourself be deceived. 
Instead of Ulysses self-bonded,       7210 
We bind with good advice. On! When you reach noble Chiron, You’ll find it’s as I promised.  
 
(Faust wanders off .) 
 
Mephistopheles  (In a temper .) 
 What croaks by me on beating wing, 
So quick that one can’t see a thing.      7215 
And one behind the other, flying? Even a hunter would weary of these. 
 
A Sphinx 
 
That storm, like the winds of winter, here, 
Hercules’ arrows could scarce get near: 
They are the swift Stymphalides,      7220 And their croaked greetings are well-meant, 
The vulture-beaked, and goose-webbed. 
They’d gladly appear in our place, 
As a closely-related race.  
Mephistopheles (As if intimidated .) 
 Something else is having a hissing fit.      7225  
Sphinx 
 
Don’t be worried about those either! 
They’re the heads of the Lernaean Hydra, 
Lopped from the trunk, but think they’re it. But, what’s the matter, now then? 
Why all the restless movements?      7230 
Where are you going? He’s gone!… I see that Chorus over there, that one, 
Has turned your head. You’ll get nowhere, 
Go on: greet every sweet face there! They’re Lamiae, the lustful girls,      7235 
With smiling lips, impudent curls, 
The race of Satyrs all delight in: With them a cloven foot’s the very thing.  
Mephistopheles 
 
Will you stay here? So I can find you again. 
 
Sphinx 
 
Yes! Mix with the flighty rabble.      7240 
In Egypt, we were accustomed, you know, To rule for a thousand years or so. 
And if you respect our location, 
We’ll regulate the days of Moon and Sun. We’ll sit in front of the Pyramids,      7245 To pass judgement on the nations: 
With changeless faces, there, amid 
War and peace, and inundations.  
(On the Lower Peneus .) 
 
(The river-god, surrounded by nymphs and tributary streams .) 
 
Peneus 
 
Stir, you reed-beds, whispering, flowing! 
Sigh softly, slender rushes, bowing,      7250 
Lightly, willow-bushes, rustling, 
Lisp, you poplar-branches trembling, Through the broken dream!….. 
Dreadful premonitions wake me, 
Secret quivering, now, shakes me,      7255 In my peaceful wandering stream. 
 
Faust  (Approaching the river .) 
 
If I heard true, as I believe: 
From behind the tangled leaves Of these shrubs and branches, 
Came sounds of human voices.       7260 
Then the fount seemed to chatter, And the breeze filled with laughter.  
The Nymphs (To Faust .) 
 Just to lie here, now, 
For you would be best, 
Reviving your wearied        7265 Body with coolness, 
Enjoy here forever 
Your fugitive rest: Murmuring, trickling, 
We’ll whisper, and bless.         7270 Faust 
 
I’m awake! O let them linger there 
Those images without compare, As they reached my sight. 
I’m moved so marvellously! 
Is it dream? Or is it memory?       7275 Once before, I knew this delight. The waters creep through the freshness, 
The softly swaying bushes’ thickness, 
Without rushing, barely trickling: A hundred founts from all sides press,      7280 
And gather to the purest brightness, 
Fill the pool’s shallow ring. Glowing limbs of young girls are 
Reflected by the liquid mirror, 
And added to the eye’s delight!       7285 Companionably, bathing joyfully, 
Swimming boldly, wading shyly, 
Crying out, at last, in watery fight. This sight’s enough to renew 
My eyes with gazing at the view,      7290 
But ever wider vision strains. My glance cuts sharply through the cover, Rich foliage, green wealth, around her, 
Serves to hide the noble queen. 
 Marvellous! The swans approaching:      7295 
From the bays, come softly swimming, 
Majestically pure their movement. Floating calm, in sweet society, 
But how proudly, self-delightedly, 
Head and neck are lifted, bent…..      7300 One shines out above all others, 
Boasting boldly of his favours, 
Sailing swiftly in their race: His ruffled plumage swelling, Wave-like, on the wave he’s stirring,      7305 
He hastens to the sacred place… 
The others swimming here and there, With their smooth shining feathers, 
Soon meet in fine contention, 
Drive away the frightened maidens,      7310 
Not thinking of their service, then But only of their own protection. 
 
The Nymphs 
 
Sisters, bend and set you ears 
To the river-banks’ green turf: 
If I hear rightly, coming near,       7315 That’s the sound of hooves on earth. 
If I only knew who that message might 
Be bringing, swiftly, to the Night!  
Faust 
 
To me, the ground seems ringing, too 
Echoing to some swift stallion’s hoof.      7320 
There, gaze, my eyes! Good luck, is nigh, 
Will it come to me as well? 
O, wonder without parallel! A rider trots towards us, now,       7325 Gifted, shines with spirit and power 
Grafted to a snow-white horse… 
I know him too, I can’t be wrong, It’s Philyra’s famous son! – 
Halt, Chiron! Halt! Hear my discourse…     7330 
 Chiron  (The Centaur .) 
 
What then? What is it?  
Faust 
 
    Delay a moment! Chiron 
 
I never rest. 
 
Faust 
   Well, take me with you, then! 
 
Chiron 
 
Mount! And I can question you, at leisure: 
Where are you going? You’re by the river, I’ll carry you through the flood, with pleasure.    7335 
 
Faust (Mounting his back .) 
 
Wherever you wish. My thanks forever…  
You, the great man, the noble teacher, Famed for educating the race of heroes, 
That splendid company of the Argonauts, 
And all who edified the Poets’ thoughts.     7340  
Chiron 
 
All that in its proper place! 
As Mentor, even Pallas wasn’t rated: 
In the end they do things their own way, 
As if they’d none of them been educated.  
Faust 
 
The doctor who can name the plants,      7345 
And roots, profoundly, understands: 
Who heals the sick, and soothes the wound, Here, strong in mind and body, have I found! 
 Chiron 
 
When a hero was injured near me. 
I gave the right assistance and advice:      7350 But, at last, bequeat hed my art, you see, 
To priests, and herb -gathering old wives. 
 
Faust 
 
You’ve a truly great man’s ways: 
He won’t hear a word of praise. He’ll modestly defer to us        7355 
And act as if all were equals.  
 
Chiron 
 
You seem artful at those pretences, Which flatter common folk and princes. 
 
Faust 
 
But surely you’d confess today: 
You saw the greatest, of your age,      7360 Among the noblest deeds, you trod, And lived life as a demi-god. 
Among those great heroic forms, 
Who was the finest of them all?  
Chiron 
 
Among the Argonauts, in my day,      7365 
Each was worthy, in his own way. 
And with the powers he inhaled, Knew enough when others failed. 
Castor and Pollux always conquered, 
When youth and beauty we re honoured.     7370 
In determination, and swift help to others, 
First was Calais, and Zetes his brother, 
Thoughtful, clever, strong, well-advised, 
Jason conquered, woma n-folk’s delight. Then Orpheus: gentle, always brooding,     7375 
Sounding the lyre, quite over-powering. 
Sharp-eyed Lynceus, by night and day, 
Steering the sacred ship past reef and bay… Let such dangers always be faced as brothers: 
If one achieves he’s praised by all the others.    7380 
 
Faust 
 
Of Hercules, you say nothing? 
 
Chiron 
 
Oh! Don’t rouse my yearning…. 
Never noting how Phoebus 
Ares, or Hermes, were defined, 
With my own eyes I saw before us      7385 What all men praise as divine. 
He was born a king, no other, 
A splendid youth to gaze upon: Yielding to his elder brother, 
And the loveliest of women.       7390 
Gaea’s never known a second, Nor Hebe led such on to heaven’s zone: In vain for him they sing the songs, 
In vain for him they carve the stone. 
 
Faust 
 
The sculptors never caught his form,      7395 
However many images they made. 
You’ve spoken of th e loveliest man, 
Now speak about the loveliest maid! Chiron 
 
What!…I won’t talk of woman’s beauty, 
It’s so often a frozen mask to me:      7400 I can only praise that nature, truly, 
Flowing freely, and cheerfully. 
Beauty’s delighted with itself: Grace makes it irresistible, Like Helen, whom I carried.       7405 
 
Faust  
You carried her? 
 
Chiron 
 
      Yes on this very back. 
 
Faust 
 
Was I not sufficiently aroused? 
Such a seat, now, will bring me luck! 
 
Chiron 
 
She gripped me by the mane, so, 
As you are doing.  
Faust 
 
  I’m vanquished, oh,      7410 
Completely! Tell me, why here? 
She is my one and only desire! Carried her from where, to where? 
 
Chiron 
 
That’s easy to tell, since you enquire. 
At that time, the Dioscuri, Castor and Pollux,    7415 
Freed their sister, Helen, from a nest of robbers. The robbers then, not used to being conquered, 
Regained their courage, and chased them onward. 
The sister and brothers’ hasty course was halted 
By all the swamps that lie  below Eleusis:     7420 
The brothers waded: I swam over, swiftly: 
Then she sprang off, and, stroking gently 
My wet mane, caresse d me, thanked me,  
Confident, sweetly clever were her ways. She was so charming! Youth, delighting Age!    7425 
 
Faust 
 
Only ten years old!… 
 
Chiron 
 
              The philologists deceive you, 
I see, while deceiving themselves too. 
It’s strange that with a mythological woman, 
Poets use her, at will, to draw our attention, 
She can never age, is never old,       7430 
Cast in the same enticing mould, 
Seduced when young, in age delights: Enough, no age restricts a poet’s flights.  
Faust 
 
Then let her be as if no age has bound her! 
As Achilles on Pherae once found her,      7435 
Beyond all ages. What rare luck: In spite of every fate, to win her love! 
And shall I, by the strength of my yearning, 
Not draw that unique form towards me, living, That eternal being, equal to the divine,     7440 
Great yet tender: kind as she’s sublime.  
You saw her once: today I too have seen her, 
Lovely in her attraction: as lovely as desired. Now my soul and being is strongly tied: 
If I can’t win her, I shan’t survive.      7445 Chiron 
 
Ah, stranger! You’re enraptured like Mankind: 
Among us Spirits you seem maddened, blind. Yet now your fate is to be met with here: 
Though only for a moment, every year, 
I take the time to call on Manto, there,      7450 Aesculapius’ daughter: in silent prayer Imploring her father to add to his fame, 
Enlighten, at last, each rash doctor’s brain, 
And persuade them never to deal death again… 
I like her best of all the crowd of Sibyls,     7455 
Free of grimaces, kind and generous: 
If you stay with her, she’s the power too, To heal you totally: with herbs and roots. 
 
Faust 
 
I don’t need healing: my mind is filled with power: 
There I’d become as base as others are.     7460 
 
Chiron 
 
Don’t scorn the healing of the noble fount! 
We’ve reached the place, so, quick, dismount! 
 
Faust 
 
Tell me, where, th rough pebbly water, 
In the gloomy night, you’ve brought us?  
Chiron 
 
Here Greece and Rome brav ed the fight,     7465 
Olympus to your left, Peneus on the right,  
The greatest empire lost here to the sand: A king flees: and citizens win the land. Gaze around! Famous Tempe is nearby, 
Eternal, there, under the moonlit sky.      7470 
 Manto (Inside, dreaming .) 
 
Horses’ hooves sound 
On sacred ground, Demi-gods are nigh us. 
 
Chiron  
Quite right! 
Just open your eyes!        7475 
 Manto  (Waking .) 
 
Welcome! I see you don’t keep away.  
Chiron 
 
And your temple’s still here to stay! 
 
Manto 
 
You still gallop round, untiringly? 
 
Chiron 
 
And you, as ever, sit peacefully, 
While I enjoy circling round.       7480  
Manto 
 
I wait, and Time ci rcles me I’ve found. 
And him? 
 
Chiron 
 
      The shadowy night 
Has whirled him to our sight. Helen he wants to win, 
Helen’s maddening him.        7485 
And he doesn’t know where or how to begin: Above all he deserves th e Aesculapian healing. 
 
Manto  
 
I like the ones who want impossible things. 
 
(Chiron is already far off .) 
 Rash man, advance, he re’s joy for you! 
This dark path leads to Persephone too.     7490 
Under Olympus’ hollow foot, stealing, She listens for secret, forbidden greeting. 
I smuggled Orpheus down here once before: 
Use your chance better! Quick! Be sure!  
(They descend .) Part II Act II Scene IV: On  The Upper Peneus Again 
 
The Sirens 
 
Plunge now in Peneus’ flood!       7495 
Here you can delight in swimming, 
Song on song too, harmonising, Does unlucky people good. There’s no healing without water! 
With the shining crowd run we       7500 
Quick, to the Aegean Sea, Where every joy’s on offer. 
 
(An Earthquake .) 
 
The foaming wave sweeps wider, 
Flowing in its bed no longer: Earth shakes and waters roar,       7505 
Stony banks split once more. 
We fly on! Come, one and all! We’ll not profit from this at all. 
On! Each noble, happy guest, 
To the ocean’s cheerful zest,       7510 Gleaming, where the trembling waves Lightly heaving, wash the bays: 
Where the moon’s reflected light, 
Wets with heaven’s dew, at night. There, a freely flowing life,       7515 
Here, an earthquake’s fearful strife: 
Every clever one, hasten on! This place is a hideous one. Seismos  (Growling and jolting in the deep .) 
 
Push again, with power, 
With your shoulders, tower!       7520 So the world above is ours, 
Where all must yield to us. 
 
The Sphinxes 
 
What a horrid shuddering, 
Ugly, hideous juddering! What a quivering and swaying,       7525 
Back and forwards,  playing! 
What an intolerable fuss! But we’ll not lose our place, 
Even if all hell shakes. 
Now a dome is lifted,        7530 Wonderful. He’s gifted 
It to us, the ancient one, 
Delos’ isle was his creation, Driven from out the wave, 
To bring Latona aid.         7535 
He with striving, pushing, pressing, Arms straight, and shoulders bending, Like an Atlas in his action, 
Lifts rock and earth, in motion, 
Shingle, gravel, sand: the floors       7540 All along our peaceful shores.  
Rips our vale’s quiet surface up, 
Crosswise, with a single cut: Fiercely, and unwearied, 
A colossal caryatid,        7545 
Bears a fearsome weight of boulders, Still buried, downwards to his shoulders: 
But he’ll come no further, now,  
The Sphinxes’ place is here, we vow.  Seismos 
 
I myself achieved all this,       7550 
Man should admit it, finally: If I’d not jolted and shaken it,  
How could the world be so lovely? – 
How could your peaks stand so high, In the pure and splendid blue,       7555 If I’d not pushed them to the sky, 
Picturesque and charming too? 
Then, thinking of my high ancestry, Night and Chaos, I behaved badly, 
And, a company of Titans, we       7560 
With Pelion and Ossa played madly, Romping round in youthful glee, 
Till, we tired of it, at last, 
And set both mountains, wickedly, On Parnassus, as a double hat….       7565 
There, now, Apollo’s sweet retreat, 
With the happy band of Muses. And Jupiter, thunderbolts complete: 
I even raised the high seat he uses. 
So now with monstrous striving       7570 I’ve pushed this upwards, from the deep, And call, aloud, to their new being, 
The joyful dwellers of the steep. 
 
The Sphinxes 
 
One would think long ago, 
This was lifted to the sky,       7575  
Had we not seen from down below, 
How it wormed its way on high. A bushy forest covers it, 
And rock on rock is piled around: 
Sphinxes don’t care about it,       7580 It won’t disturb our sacred ground. The Gryphons 
 
Gold in leaves, and gold in spangles, 
Through the cracks, see, it tremble. Don’t you rob us of our treasure, 
Ants, come, gather it together!       7585 
 
Chorus of Ants 
 
As this the giant ones 
Threw to the sky, You restless-footed ones, 
Quick, climb it on high! 
Rapidly in and out!        7590 In cracks like these, 
Every crumb about’s 
Worth you can seize. You must uncover 
Even the slightest,         7595 
In every corner Quick as the brightest. 
You must be everywhere, 
Swarming around: then, Only bring gold here!        7600 Forget the mountain. 
 
The Gryphons 
 
Come! Come! Heap the gold! 
With our claws, we’ll keep hold: They are the best locks yet: 
Great treasures they protect.       7605 
 The Pygmies (Classical Dwarves .) 
 
We’ve acquired some room, 
How, it isn’t clear. Don’t ask where we’re from: 
The main thing is we’re here! 
Life is cheerfully suited        7610 To every sort of land: 
Where a rock is lifted, 
Dwarves are there, on hand. 
Men and maids, quick and busy, Exemplary, every pair:        7615 
In Paradise, once, maybe, 
A similar race lived there. But the best is here we find, Thankfully our fate is blessed: 
Mother Earth is always kind,       7620 
In the East as in the West.  
The Dactyls  (Little  Ironworkers .) 
 If she can bring to light 
The Little Ones in a night, 
The Littlest Ones, she can make And each will still find a mate.       7625 
 
The Pygmy-Elders 
 
Hurry: make space: 
A convenient place! Quickly, to work! Strength, never shirk! 
While we’re in peace,        7630 
Our smithy increase, To furnish the horde 
With armour and sword. 
All you ant-forms, Moving in swarms,        7635 
Bring us the ore! 
And all you Dactyls, So many, so little, 
You are commanded 
To bring us the wood!        7640 Heap it up higher, Secretive fire, 
Fetch coals as you should. 
 The Pygmy Generalissimo 
 
Look lively, though, 
With arrow and bow!        7645 Shoot me the herons 
Out in the ponds, 
Countless they’re nests, Proud are their breasts, Shoot them, together,        7650 
All in one blow! 
So we can show Helmets with feathers. 
 
Ants and Dactyls  
Who now can save us! 
We bring the iron         7655 They forge the fetters. 
It won’t be soon 
This thing will end, Meanwhile we bend. 
 
The Cranes of Ibycus 
 
Cries of murdered, calls of dying!      7660 
Fearful fluttering and flying! 
Such deep moans, and such groans Carry to our airy zones! 
All already slaughtered, 
Blood is reddening the water,       7665 Misshapen dwarfish passions, 
Steal the herons’ noblest gems. 
Now they’re waving on their helmets: Those fat-bellied bow-legged serpents. 
You our armies’ members,       7670 
Files of ocean-wanderers, You we call to vengeance, To kin-related business. 
No one spare his strength or blood! 
Show hatred always to that brood!      7675  
(They disperse, croaking .) 
 
Mephistopheles (On the plain .) 
 
Northern witches were  easily controlled, 
But over foreign spirits I’ve no hold. The Blocksberg’s a most convenient locale, Wherever you are, you’ll find yourself there still. 
Dame Ilse watches for us, from her tall stone,    7680 
And Heinrich’s still awake on his high throne, At Elend, the Snorers snore away, 
All’s done for a thousand years and a day. 
Who knows here if, wh ere he sits, you see, 
The Earth won’t swell up beneath his feet?….    7685 
I wander happily through a level valley, 
And in a moment there,  thrown up behind me, 
A mountain, true it’s hard ly to be called one, 
But high enough to hide the Sphinxes’ home – 
Still, the valley breeds ma ny a fire here,     7690 
And so illuminates this mad affair…. 
The magic sparks of that charming chorus. 
Still enticing, vanishing, hover near us. Gently now! All too used to nibbling,  Wherever we are, we find ourselves snatching.    7695 
 
The Lamiae  (Drawing Mephistopheles after them .) 
 
Faster, and faster! 
And ever further! Then hover again, 
Chattering, staying. 
It’s such a pleasure,        7700 To make the old sinner, 
Pursue us, at whim, 
Doing hard penance. See, with his lame stance, He hobbles forwards,        7705 
He stumbles onwards: 
Trailing his leg, mind: As we flee from him 
He follows behind! 
 
Mephistopheles (Standing still .) 
 
Cursed fate! Cheated every which way!     7710 
Since Adam, seduced and led astray! We grow old, but who grows wise? Now, I’m tormented to the skies! 
We know they’re a w holly useless sex, 
With laced-in bodies, and painted looks.     7715 No healthy response at all, at bottom, 
Wherever you grip, their limbs are rotten. 
We know, we see, we grasp their ways, But still we dance when woman plays! 
 
The Lamiae (Pausing .) 
 
Stop! He thinks: pauses: stays too:      7720 
Return, then, lest he should escape you!  
Mephistopheles (Striding forwards .) 
 On, then! And let no indecision Grip my flesh, some foolish cavil: 
Since if there were no witches given, 
Who the devil’d want to be a devil!      7725  
The Lamiae  (Very graciously .) 
 We are circling round the hero! 
Let love, in his heart, be sure to 
Choose one of us for certain though.  
Mephistopheles 
 
True, in this uncertain shimmer, 
You seem pretty girls together,       7730 
I’d like not to scorn you so. 
 Empusa  (The demon. Pressing forward .) 
 
Nor me! I’m the very thing, 
Let me join your following.  
The Lamiae 
 
She’s one too many in our crowd, 
She’ll spoil our game if she’s allowed.      7735 
 
Empusa  (To Mephistopheles .) 
 
Greetings from Empusa, to you, 
Your cousin, with the ass’s hoof! You’ve only a horse’s hoof, it’s true, 
Yet, cousin, all the best to you! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I thought there were only strangers here,     7740 
Sadly, now, relatives appear: 
It’s the old story: in their dozens, 
From Hartz to Hellas, always cousins!  
Empusa 
 
I act quickly with decision, 
I can alter to your vision:        7745 
But to honour you today 
My ass’s head I display.  
Mephistopheles 
 
I see great things are signified, 
By the relationship implied: 
Be that as it may, yet I,        7750 The ass’s head will still deny. The Lamiae 
 
That ugly thing gives the frights, 
To all that’s lovely and delights: The lovely and delightful before, 
When she arrives, are so no more!      7755 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
These cousins too, so soft and slender, 
Are all suspicious, all that gender: And beneath their cheeks, those roses, 
There too, I fear, are metamorphoses. 
 
The Lamiae 
 
Try us then! We’re many.       7760 
Grasp! And if you’re lucky, 
Secure the finest prize. 
What was all that lusting for? You’re a miserable suitor, 
Strutting, boasting of your size! –      7765 
Now he’s mixing with our crowd: Drop your masks: you’re allowed:  And bare your being to his eyes. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I’ve chosen the loveliest one… 
 (Clasping her. ) 
 
Oh! What a skinny broom!       7770  
(Clasping another .) 
 And this one?…Wizened looks! The Lamiae 
 
You’re worth better?  Not in our books. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
That little one might suit my plans… 
A lizard gliding through my hands! And snakelike are her slippery tresses.      7775 
I try the tall one to compare… 
I grip a thyrsus  without hair, 
A pinecone, for a head, impresses! 
What next?….A fat one, see, 
Perhaps she’ll enliven me:       7780 Let’s risk it, then! Here she is! 
So puffy, flabby, in the East  
There they’d prize her looks, at least… But, oh! The puff-ball’s split! 
 
The Lamiae 
 
Scatter widely, swaying, floating,      7785 
Surround him in dark flight, like lightning, The trespassing witch’s son! Circles, terrifying, winging! 
Bat-like in a silent flickering! 
He’ll be grateful when we’ve done.      7790 
 
Mephistopheles (Shaking himself .) 
 I’m no cleverer it seems, at all: 
Here’s absurd, and so’s the north, 
Here and there, the spirits tricky, Poetry and people tacky. 
Here too it’s masquerade, I find:      7795 
As everywhere, the dance of mind. I grasped a lovely masked procession, And caught things from a horror show… 
I’d gladly settle for a false impression, 
If it would last a little longer, though.      7800  
(He loses his way among the rocks .) 
 
Where am I now? Where will it wander? There was a path, now it’s a horror. 
I got here by smooth and level ways, 
And now the scree prevents escape. I clamber up and down in vain,       7805 How shall I find the Sphinx again? 
I’ve never known anything like it, quite, 
A mountain range in a single night! I call it a lively witches’ ride, 
They’ve brought the Blocksberg, beside.     7810 
 An Oread  (A mountain nymph, from the natural rock .) 
 
Climb up here! My range is old, In primeval forms the peaks unfold. 
Respect the steep and rocky stair, 
Pindus’ last slopes stretch there! Unshakeable, once I stood, as now,      7815 
When Pompey fled  across my brow. 
Beside me, illusion’s stones will go, As soon as ever the cock shall crow. I often see such fables thrown on high, 
And suddenly sink back again and die.     7820 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Honour to you, you noble length, Garlanded high with  oaken strength! 
The clearest moonlight never weaves 
Through the darkness of your leaves – I see a light, with parting glow,       7825 
Through the silent bushes go. 
How all things come together! Homunculus it is who’s there! Which way now, little fellow? Homunculus 
 
I flit about from hill to hollow       7830 
And, in the truest sense, I’d gladly ‘be’, I’m so impatient, now, to smash the glass: 
Only, so far, given what I can see, 
I wouldn’t want to do it in this pass. But in confidence I confess I was      7835 On the trail of two philosophers, 
All I heard them say was: Nature, Nature! 
I’ll not part from them for anything, They must know about earthly being: 
And in the end I’ll find out, too,       7840 
The cleverest place to travel to.  
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Well, do it on your own behalf, here. 
Where the spirits all find their place, 
The Philosopher can show his face. To please you with his art and favour,      7845 
He’ll make you a dozen, any flavour. 
You’ll have no intellect, unless you err. If you want to ‘be’, make it your own affair!  
Homunculus 
 
Good advice too is not to be disdained . 
 
Mephistopheles  
Then off with you! I’ll look around again.     7850 
 (They part .) Anaxagoras  (To Thales .) 
 
The stubborn mind will never ever bend: 
What more do you need to be enlightened?  
Thales 
 
The waves will gladly bow to every wind, 
Yet far from the jagged cliffs they’ll end. 
 
Anaxagoras 
 
This cliff came about by fiery vapours.     7855 
 
Thales 
 
By moisture living things were created. 
 
Homunculus (Between the two .) 
 Let me walk beside you, please. 
I myself desire to ‘be’! 
 
Anaxagoras 
 
Have you, O Thales, in a single night 
Brought a mount, from mud, to light?      7860  
Thales 
 
Never has nature in her living flow, 
Been bound to day, night, and hours, though. 
She creates every form by rule, At her greatest, force is never her tool.  Anaxagoras 
 
Here it was! Furious Plutonic fire,      7865 
Monstrous Aeolian vapours thrown higher, Broke through the ancient earth’s smooth crust, 
And raised the new mount with a swift up-thrust. 
 
Thales  
What more will come of it? 
It’s there, that’s fine: let it sit.       7870 One loses time in remonstrance, 
And only leads the patient folk a dance. 
 
Anaxagoras 
 
The Mount quickly filled with Myrmidons, Living in the rocky clefts and caverns: 
Pygmies, ants and fingerlings,       7875 
And other active little things.  
(To Homunculus .) 
 You’ve not striven hard for greatness, Lived hermit-like, in narrowness: 
If you can accustom yourself to power, 
I’ll crown you their king, in an hour.      7880  
Homunculus 
 
What does Thales say? 
 
Thales 
 
                     It’s not my recommendation: 
With small means, you’ll only do small actions: With great means, the small achieve great ones. Look there! A dark cloud, see, the cranes come! 
So the excitable crowd will threaten,      7885 
And they would threaten the king so. With sharpened beak, and grasping claw, 
They tread the small ones to the floor: 
Fate falls like lightning on those below. 
It was a crime to kill the herons,      7890 Caught on their quiet and peaceful ponds. 
But that rain of arrowed slaughter, 
Brings cruel and bloody vengeance after, Summons the anger of their kin above, To spill the Pygmies’ guilty blood.      7895 
What need for helmets, shields and spears? 
What use the dwarves’ heron-feather? How Dactyls and Ants hide together! 
The army wavers, flie s, and disappears. 
 Anaxagoras (After a moment, solemnly .) 
 
Till now I’ve praised the subterranean powers,    7900 But turn, in this case, to higher ones than ours… 
You! Above, alwa ys evergreen, 
Triple-named, triply to be seen, I cry to you, by my people’s woe, 
Diana, Luna, Hecate, so!         7905 
You, in deepest thought, the heartening, You power profound, calmly shining, Reveal your dark side’s fearful shower, 
Without spells, show your ancient power! 
 (A pause .) 
 
Am I heard so swiftly?        7910 Has my cry 
To the deep sky 
Stirred Nature’s ranks so quickly? Already, greater, greater, nearing, 
The Goddess’ orbed throne appearing,      7915 
Monstrous, fearful to the sight! With fires that redden in the night… No closer, threatening disc of power! 
You’ll straight destroy us: sea and shore! 
So it was true, the Thessalian women,      7920 Trusted with wicked magic runes, 
Enchanted you from your circling path, 
Wrested evil things from you, in wrath?… 
The bright shield now darkens, Suddenly splits: flashes, sparkles!      7925 
What a hissing! What a drumming! 
Thunder, wind, and rain are coming! – Humbled, on the steps of your throne! – Forgive me! I brought this on, alone. 
 
(He throws himself on his face .) 
 
Thales 
 
What has this man not heard and seen!     7930 
I’m not sure what it was that’s been, 
I’m not sensitive to it like him, I find. We’d confess, these are crazy times, 
The Moon is quivering quite gently, 
In her place, though, just as formerly.      7935  
Homunculus 
 
Look there, at the Pygmies seat! 
The mount was round, now it’s a peak. 
I felt the monstrous recoil’s thunder, 
A rock fell from the Moon up yonder: All alike, without asking too,       7940 
Friend and foe it squashed and slew. 
I have to praise powers like those, All creation in a single night, 
Alike up there as down below, 
Bringing a mountain-heap to light.      7945  
Thales 
 
Peace! It was just an imaginary sight. 
So farewell to that ugly brood! 
You didn’t become king, that’s good. 
Off now to the sea-festival, joy-blessed, Where they’ll honour a marvellous guest.     7950  
(They exit .) 
 
Mephistopheles (Climbing up the opposite side .) 
 
I’ll have to climb through these steep rocks, Through the roots of ancient oaks! 
In my Hartz range, the smell of resin 
Has a hint of pitch, almost as pleasant As sulphur…but here, among the Greeks,     7955 
There’s not a sniff, wherever one seeks: 
But I’m still rather curious to know How they make hellfire and brimstone glow. 
 
A Dryad  (A wood nymph .) 
 In your own land, you ’re naturally adept, 
Abroad, you don’t know enough as yet.     7960 
You shouldn’t think about home, here 
With these ancient oak trees to revere. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
One thinks of all one’s left: besides, 
What one’s used to is paradise. But tell me what’s in that cave       7965 
Dimly crouching, a triple shape? 
 
The Dryad 
 
Daughters of Phorkyas! Enter the place, 
And speak to them, if you’re not afraid.  
Mephistopheles 
 
Why not! – I’ll look, and I’m amazed! 
Proud as I am, I must conf ess, though,      7970 
I’ve never seen the likes of those, 
They’re as foul as Ugliness any day…. How can one find deadly sin Ugly at all when one has seen 
This triple monstrosity?        7975 
We wouldn’t let them cross the sill Of the worst chamber of our hell. 
But here, in the land of beauty, all things Greek, 
Are famous now because they’re so antique… They seem to scent my presence: stirring,     7980 
Like vampire bats, squeaking, twittering. 
 The Phorkyads  (The Three Graeae ) 
 
Give me the eye, Sisters, so I can find Who’s wandering so near our shrine. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Most Revered! Allow me near, 
To receive a triple blessing here.      7985 
I come, as yet unknown it’s true, But distantly related, I think, to you. 
I’ve already seen the elder gods, 
Bowed low before Rhea and Ops: I even saw the Fates, your sisters,      7990 
Yesterday, or the day before: 
But I’ve never seen the likes of you. I’m silenced now, and delighted too. 
 
The Phorkyads 
 
This spirit seems to have some sense. Mephistopheles 
 
I’m amazed no poet’s had th e intelligence     7995 
To sing of you. Tell me, how can that be? I’ve never seen you properly painted: 
The chisel should only try to carve you, 
Not the likes of Pallas, Venus, Juno.  
The Phorkyads 
 
Deep in solitude and stillest night,      8000 
No one ever thought to show us three aright. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
How could they? Here, concealed from view. 
You can’t see anyone: and they can’t see you. You need to achieve a suitable place, 
Where art and splendour sh are the space,     8005 
Where every day, as walking, living heroes, With giant steps, each block of marble goes. 
Where – 
 
The Phorkyads 
 
    Be silent, and don’t tempt us to roam! 
What use would it be to us, to be better known? 
Born in the night, and related to the night,     8010 
To ourselves, almost: to others quite out of sight. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
In that case, there’ s little more to say: 
One can oneself to others still betray. 
One eye’s enough for three, one tooth as well: 
Then it should be mythically possible,      8015 To contain three beings in two, And leave me the third form, too. 
For a little while. 
 A Phorkyad 
 
What do you think? Shall we try? 
 
The Others 
 
Let’s! – But without the tooth and eye. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Now you’ve denied me the best  features of all:    8020 
How can I show your strict and perfect form? 
 
A Phorkyad 
 
Shut one eye, that’s easy to do, 
Let one greedy tooth show too, In profile you’ll at once achieve 
A sisterly likeness, to deceive.       8025 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Many thanks! Done!  
The Phorkyads 
 
   Done! 
 
Mephistopheles (As a Phorkyad, in profile .) 
    Already I’m one, 
Of Chaos’s well-beloved sons! 
 
The Phorkyads 
 
We’re Chaos’s daughters, of undisputed right. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
O shame, now I’ll be called a hermaphrodite.  
The Phorkyads 
 
What a beauty in our sisterly trio!      8030 
We’ve two eyes, and two teeth now. 
 
Mephistopheles  
I’ll hide myself from every eye, as well, 
And frighten devils in the lakes of Hell. 
 (He exits .) Part II Act II Scene V: Rock y Coves in the Aegean Sea 
 
(The Moon, lingering, at the zenith .) 
 The Sirens  (Lying on the cliffs round about , playing flutes and singing .) 
 
Though the Thessalian witch-women Wickedly, dragged you down to them,      8035 With their horrors, long ago, in the dark, 
Look quietly down, now, from the arc 
Of night, on waves of glittering sparks: Mildly flashing, bright crowds, these: 
Shine now upon the swelling seas,      8040 
Which raise themselves from the deep! We’re sworn to serve you, thus, 
Sweet Luna, show grace to us. 
 The Nereids and Tritons  (As marvels of the deep .) 
 
Sound out loud, with clearer tones, Ringing through the sea’s wide zones:      8045 
Call the peoples of the deep! 
Before the storm’s ravening face, We sank to the stillest place, Now we’re drawn, by singing, sweet. 
See, how we’ve adorned ourselves,      8050 
In our great delight, as well, With our crowns, so nobly gemmed, 
And our belts with spangles hemmed! 
These spoils, now, before you, we lay, Treasures, shipwrecked here, and swallowed,    8055 
Your enticing songs they followed, 
You the daemons of our bay.  
The Sirens 
 
We know well, in ocean freshness, 
Fishes play in slippery smoothness, 
Flickering lives, devoid of pain:       8060 
Yet you festive crowds that stray We would rather find today, 
That you’re more than fish, again. 
 
The Nereids and Tritons  
Before we came to meet you, 
We were thinking of that too:       8065 Speed away now, sisters: brothers! It only needs the slightest journey, 
For most effective proof that we, 
Certainly, are more  than fishes. 
 
(They swim off .) 
 
The Sirens 
 
They’ve vanished in a moment!       8070 To Samothrace they’re bent, 
Gone, with a favourable breeze. 
What is it they think they’ll see, In the realm of the noble Cabiri? 
They’re gods! But wondrously strange,     8075 
Always causing their forms to change, Never knowing what they might be. Stay at your clear height, 
Sweet Luna, graceful light, 
So we’ll remain nocturnal,       8080 Not chased by the diurnal! 
 
Thales (On the shore, to Homunculus .) 
 
I’d gladly lead you to old Nereus: 
His home’s not far away and cavernous, But his head, it’s of the very stubbornest, 
He’s a sour-top, and quite the nastiest.      8085 
The whole human race can’t satisfy Him, the grumbler, and needn’t try. Yet to him the future is revealed, 
And so all show respect, and yield 
Him honour in his high position:      8090 He’s done quite well by many a one. 
 
Homunculus 
 
Then let’s try him, and hurry on! 
My glass and flame won’t fail our mission. 
 Nereus (The sea-god .) 
 
Are those human voices, in my ear? 
How quickly my deepest anger stirs!      8095 Forms, reaching for the gods, in their endeavour, 
Yet condemned to be themselves, forever.  
In ancient times I had heavenly rest, Yet drove myself to act well to the best: 
And then, when I’d finished what I’d done,     8100 
It was quite clear that nothing had been won. 
 
Thales 
 
And yet, Old Man of th e Sea, we trust you: 
You’re the Wise: so don’t drive us from you! 
See this flame, he’s almost human, really, He yields himself to your advice, completely.    8105  
Nereus 
 
What advice! Has Mankind valued my advice? 
A wise word’s frozen in a stubborn ear. 
No matter how often some  harsh action strikes, 
People remain as self-willed as before. 
I warned Paris himself, in a fatherly way,     8110 
Before the foreign girl tempted him to stray. He stood bravely on the shore of Greece, 
And I told him what my Spirit could see: 
The smoke-filled air, the streaming blood, Glowing timbers, slaughter’s flood,      8115 Troy’s day of judgement, caught in verse, 
Its horrors known for te n thousand years.  
The old man’s words seem ed idle to the young, He followed his need, and Ilium was gone – 
A bloody corpse, frozen with ancient pain,     8120 
For Pindus’ eagles, a literary gain. 
Ulysses too! Didn’t I tell him about Circe’s wiles, that Cyclopean lout? 
The indecision in his own shallow mind, 
And all of it! What benefit did he find?     8125 Till, late indeed, the ocean favoured him more, 
And brought him, wave-tosse d, to a friendly shore. 
 
Thales 
 
Such behaviour brings the wise man pain, 
Yet the good will chance it all again. An ounce of thanks will still please them deeply,    8130 
Outweighing tons of ingratitude completely. 
And it’s nothing slight we ask of you: The boy here wants to exist, and wisely too. 
 
Nereus 
 
Don’t ruin such a rare mood as this! 
Greater needs await me, today, than his:     8135 I’ve summoned all my da ughters here to me, 
The Dorides, the Gr aces of the Sea. 
Neither Olympus, nor your lands can show 
Such lovely forms, w ith such delicate flow, 
They fling themselves, with graceful actions,    8140 
From sea-horses to Neptune’s stallions, 
Blending so sensitively with the element, That they seem made of  foam, to all intent. 
In a play of colours, on Venus’ chariot shell, 
Galatea, the loveliest, comes to me, as well,     8145 
Who, since Cypris turned away from us, 
Rules as the new divinity of Paphos. 
And so, heiress, for ages now, the sweet one, Holds town, and temple, chariot and throne. Away! It’s time for a father’s enjoyments,     8150 
Hearts without hate, lips without judgements. 
Away, to Proteus! Ask that wondrous man: How man exists, and ch anges, if he can. 
 
(He vanishes into the sea .) 
 
Thales 
 
We’ll achieve nothing by that game, 
Meet Proteus: he’ll vanish, just the same:     8155 And if he stays, he’ll only tell you, 
What will amaze you, and confuse you. 
But you’ve need of such advice, Well, make tracks, then, and we’ll try! 
 
(They depart .) 
 
The Sirens  (On the rocks above .) 
 What is it we see whitening       8160 
The realms of ocean, brightening? 
As when the wind prevails, And shows the snowy sails, 
So the Ocean’s daughters, 
Transfigured, light the waters.       8165 Let us clamber shore-wards, So we can hear their voices. 
 
The Nereids and Tritons 
 
What in our hands we treasure, 
Will give you all great pleasure. Chelone’s turtle shield        8170 
The shining form we wield: 
On it gods we’re bringing: Your noblest songs, be singing. 
 
The Sirens 
 
Little in form, 
Great in the storm,         8175 
Saving the shipwrecked, Gods always respected. 
 
The Nereid and Tritons 
 
We bring the peaceful Cabiri 
To lead in your festivity, 
Since in their holy presence,       8180 Neptune’s always pleasant.  
The Sirens 
 
We’re attendant on you: 
When a ship broke in two, 
Their sovereign power too, Protected the crew.         8185 
 
The Nereids and Tritons  
We’ve brought three of them along, 
The fourth said he wouldn’t come: He said he was the real one, 
The only thinker of the squadron. 
 
The Sirens 
 
One god will always mock       8190 
At some other god. Honour all their courtesy, 
Be fearful of their injury. 
 
The Nereids and Tritons 
 
Actually, there are seven. 
 
The Sirens 
 
Where are the other three, then?       8195 
 
The Nereids and Tritons 
 We really can’t tell you that, 
On Olympus one might ask: 
There the eighth pines away, 
No one thinks of him today! Granted us in mercy,        8200 
But not yet completely. 
These, the in comparable, 
Ever wider yearning, Hungering, are longing 
For the unattainable.         8205 
 
The Sirens 
 
We’re ones who know 
Where it’s enthroned, 
To moon and to sun, 
We pray: and it’s done.  
The Nereids and Tritons 
 
See how our great glory grows,       8210 
We lead them to the feast! 
 
The Sirens 
 
The heroes of ancient story, 
Are deficient now in glory, Whatever we might be told: 
Though they won the fleece of gold,      8215 
You’re the Cabiri.  
(Repeated as a full chorus .) 
 ‘Though they won the fleece of gold, 
We’re the Cabiri’. 
 (The Nereids and Tritons move past .) 
 
Homunculus 
 I see these unformed ones, 
Like pots of shoddy clay,        8220 
Against them wise men run, 
And break their heads today. 
 
Thales 
 
That’s what men ask of the dust: 
The coin gains value from its rust.   
 
Proteus (Unnoticed .) 
 
It pleases me, an old connoisseur of fable!     8225 
The odder it is, the mo re respectable.  
 
Thales 
 
Where are you, Proteus? 
 
Proteus  (Like a ventriloquist, apparently far, and close to .) 
 
            Here! Here, too! 
 
Thales 
 
An old joke, which I’ll forgive you: 
No idle words for a friend, please! I know you’re trying to deceive.      8230 
 
Proteus (As if from the distance .) 
 
Farewell! 
 Thales (Quietly to Homunculus .) 
 
He’s quite near. So, light, afresh! 
He’s just as curious as any fish: And whatever form he hides in, 
A flame will easily entice him. 
 Homunculus 
 
I’ll pour out a whole flood of light,      8235 
But soft, so the glass is still all right.  
Proteus (In the form of a giant turtle .) 
 What shines with su ch grace and beauty? 
 
Thales (Covering up Homunculus .) 
 Good! If you wish, come close to see. 
It’s worth a little trouble, if you can: 
Show yourself two-footed like a man.      8240 At our discretion, and by our favour.  
We’ll show you what we’re hiding here. 
 
Proteus (In a noble form .) 
 
You still know all the worldly tricks.  
Thales 
 
Changing shape is what you still like best. 
 
(He reveals Homunculus .) 
 Proteus  (Astonished .) 
 
A shining dwarf! That, I’ve never seen!    8245 
 
Thales 
 
He seeks advice, and would gladly ‘be’. 
He is, as I’ve heard him say before, 
Quite miraculously, only half born. He’s not lacking in mental qualities, But short of physical capabilities:      8250  
Only the glass has given him weight at all, 
He’d gladly be embodied, first of all.  
Proteus 
 
You are a true virgin’s son, 
Before you should be, you’re already one! 
 
Thales  (Whispering .) 
 From another point of view, it’s critical:     8255 
I think it makes him hermaphroditical.  
 
Proteus 
 
All the easier to achieve success: 
Whatever he gets will suit him best. 
No need to think about it here: 
In the ocean deep you must appear!      8260 There, first, in mini ature, one snatches, 
Enjoying the smallest things to swallow, 
Bigger and bigger, with what one catches, Forming the higher being to follow. 
 
Homunculus 
 
Here quite gentle breezes blow,       8265 
It’s open: the fragrance delights me so! 
 
Proteus 
 
I think so too, loveliest of youths! 
And, further on, it’s more enjoyable: 
On that shoreline’s slender tooth, 
The watery halo’s indescribable.      8270 There we’ll see the crowds near to, 
Drifting smoothly, to our view, 
Come with me! Thales 
 
      I’ll keep you company. 
 
Homunculus 
 
A triply odd spirit-journey! Part II Act II Scene VI: The Telchines of Rhodes 
 
(The Telchines, on sea-horses and dra gons, wielding Neptune’s trident .) 
 Chorus of Telchines  (The nine dog-headed Children of the Sea ) 
 
Oh, we are the ones who once forg ed Neptune’s trident,   8275 
With which he controls the tumultuous torrent. When the thunder erupts from the heavens, and rumbles, 
Neptune will reply to those terrible grumbles: 
And however the lightning zig-zags above us, Breaker upon breaker beneath will splash upwards:    8280 
And whatever struggles between them in terror, 
Long hurled all about, the deep seas will devour: 
And that’s why he’s loaned us his sceptre today – 
Now we float, calm and light , in our festive display. 
 
The Sirens 
 
You, to Helios consecrated,       8285 
You, with bright day’s blessing freighted, 
Greetings to this hour when 
Luna’s high worship rules again! 
 
The Telchines 
 
Loveliest goddess of all in your sphere above! 
To hear your brother praised, is something you love.   8290 
To blessed Rhodes lend an ear, now, from the sky, 
Where an endless Paean, to him, rises on high. 
He begins the day’s course: he ends it again, 
He eyes us all with his radiant fiery eye, then. 
The mountains, the city, the sea and the strand,    8295 
Please the great god, lovely and bright is the land. 
No mist drifts above us, and if one appears, 
A ray, and a breeze: a nd the island shows clear! 
There the high god’s in hundre ds of statues displayed, 
As a youth, and a giant, the mild and the grave.    8300 
We were the first to carve forms: we began  
The depiction of gods in the image of Man.  
Proteus 
 
Let them sing on then, and let them boast! 
To the sun’s sacred rays, a living host, 
All their works are an empty jest.      8305 
They melt and shape untiringly: And once, in bronze, it’s plain to see, They think they’ve caught the very best. 
What happens at last to these proud ones? 
The god’s statues standing high –      8310 An earthquake tosses to the sky: 
Long since, they’re  all melted down. 
Earth’s toil, whatever else it may be, Is nothing still, but drudgery: 
The waves grant a life that’s better:      8315 
I’ll bear you to eternal waters, As Proteus-Dolphin . 
 
(Transforming himself. ) 
 
            That’s soon done! 
Now you’ll find your fairest luck: I’m carrying you across my back, To wed you with the ocean.       8320 
 
Thales 
 
Yield to your praiseworthy wish, 
Start at the beginning, with the fish! Be ready for the swiftest working! 
Be ruled by the eternal norms, 
Move through a thousand, t housand forms,     8325 
And you’ll ascend in time to Man. 
 
Proteus 
 
With spirit, join the watery plan, 
Equal in size, where all began, 
And move here as you wish to do: Don’t wrestle with the higher orders:      8330 
Once man, inside mankind’s borders, 
Then all will be over with you. 
 
Thales 
 
That’s as may be: it’s still fine, 
To be a real man, in your own time.  
Proteus (To Thales .) 
 
As long as it’s someone of your kind!      8335 
You don’t just live for some brief time: 
With your pale and ghostly peers, I’ve watched you already for hundreds of years. 
 
The Sirens (On the rocky cliffs .) 
 
What’s that ring of little clouds, set 
In a circle round the moon?       8340 They are doves, by love ignited, 
Winged, white as winter noon. 
All her ardent flocks of birds: Paphos, now, has sent to us, So our festival’s completed,        8345 
Sweet and clear our happy bliss! 
 Nereus  (Approaching Thales .) 
 
Though some nocturnal wanderer Might call it only airy moonshine: 
We spirits think it something other, 
It’s one true meaning we can find:      8350 They are doves that accompany 
My daughter in her moving shell. 
Wondrous flights of artistry, Learnt in ancient times, as well. Thales 
 
I too think that thing is best,       8355 
That can please the real man, And in warm and silent nest, 
Keep living Sacredness to hand. 
 Psylli and Marsi  (Peoples of Italy and North Africa . On sea-bulls, sea-
heifers and sea-rams.)  
 
In the hollow caves of Cyprus 
Not yet rocked, by the sea-god,       8360 
Not yet shaken, by old Seismos, 
Breathed on, by eternal breezes, And, as in the ancient days, 
Delighting in peaceful ways, 
With us Venus’ chariot stays,       8365 And through nocturnal murmurs, 
Through the sweet entwining waters, 
We lead the loveliest of daughters, Unseen by newer generation. 
Travelling on our gentle journey      8370 
No winged lion, or eagle fear we, Neither cross nor crescent, Though it’s throned in heaven, 
Though it moves and sways, 
Though it drives and slays,       8375 Crops, towns, in ruin lays. 
We, swiftly bring on 
The loveliest of women.  
The Sirens 
 
Lightly now, and gently go, 
Round the chariot, ring on ring,       8380 
Often weaving, row by row, All in order, round it, snaking, Approach you active Nereids 
Sturdy women, sweetly wild, 
Tender Dorides bring, amidst,       8385 Galatea, Mother’s child: 
Most, so goddess-like her calm, 
Worthy of immortality, 
Yet enticing, with her charm, As human femininity.        8390 
 
The Dorides  (In Chorus, mounted on dolphins, passing Nereus .) 
 Lend us, Luna, light and shadow, 
Clarity for flowering youth! 
Charming husbands here we show: Plead for them with our father, too. 
 
(To Nereus .) 
 
They are boys, whom we rescued      8395 
From the breaker’s teeth, and then, In the reeds and mosses bedded, 
Warmed them back to life again, 
Now with glowing kisses they Must thank us truly here today:       8400 
Look with favour now on them! 
 
Nereus 
 
Here there’s a dual prize, I find, to treasure: 
You show compassion, and it brings you pleasure.  
The Dorides 
 
Father, praise our mission, all, 
And sanction our fond request,       8405 
Let us hold them fast, immortal, On each young eternal breast. 
 
Nereus 
 
Be happy with your handsome catch, 
Accept the youngsters here, as men: 
I can’t myself grant what you ask,      8410 Since Zeus alone can make it happen. 
The waves that heave and rock you 
Leave no place for love to stand, 
So when this inclination leaves you, Send them quietly back to land.       8415 
 
The Dorides 
 
Sweet boys, you are so dear to us,  
But sadly we must separate: 
We asked eternal faithfulness, But the gods forbid that fate. 
 
The Young Men 
 
We’re the valiant sailor lads,       8420 
If you’d refresh us further, We’ve never had it quite so good 
And we’ll never have it better. 
 (Galatea approaches on her shell-chariot .) 
 
Nereus 
 
It’s you, my darling! 
 
Galatea 
 
                  O father! Delight! 
Linger, you dolphins, I’m gripped by the sight.    8425  
Nereus 
 
Past already, they’re moving past, 
Wheeling in circular motion: 
What care they for the heart’s deep emotion! 
Ah, if they’d just take me with them, at last! 
And yet, a single glance gives here,      8430 
Something that will last all year. 
 Thales 
 
Hail! Hail! Anew! 
How happy I feel, too, Pierced by the Beautiful and True…. 
All things came from the watery view!     8435 
All things are sustained by water! Ocean, grant us your realm forever. If you didn’t produce the clouds, 
No flowing streams would be allowed, 
The rivers wouldn’t roar and shout,      8440 The streams would never bubble out, 
Where would hill, plain, and world be then? 
The freshness of life’s what you maintain.  
An Echo  (A chorus from the collective circles .) 
 The freshness of life flows back from you, again. 
 
Nereus 
 
Floating, turning, they change place,      8445 
Far off, no longer face to face: In extended linking circles, Appropriate to the festival, 
The countless company’s weaving. 
But Galatea’s throne of shell,       8450 I see it clearly: see it still. 
It gleams like a star, 
Through the throng, A crowd, the Beloved shines among! 
Though just as far,         8455 
It shimmers bright and clear, Always true, and near. 
 
Homunculus 
 
In this delightful ocean 
Whatever I may shine on, 
Is all sweet and fair.        8460  
Proteus 
 
In this living ocean, 
You light’s shining motion, 
First rings in splendour there. 
 
Nereus 
 
At the heart of the throng, what mystery 
Offers itself for our eyes to see?       8465 What shines round the she ll, at Galatea’s feet? 
Now waxing powerful, now gentle and sweet, 
As if it were fed by the pulses of Love. 
 
Thales 
 
Homunculus, drawn there by Proteus…. 
Those are the symptoms of imperious yearning,    8470 
I’d expect now the sound of an anguished ringing: He’ll shatter himself on the glittering throne: 
He glitters, he flashes,  already, it’s done. 
 
The Sirens 
 
What fiery wonder transfigures the waves, there, 
As one on another sparkles and breaks, there?    8475 
It flashes and flickers and brightens towards us: 
The nocturnal tracks of the bodies shine round us, 
And everything near is surrounded with flame: So let Eros rule, now: who started the game! 
Hail to the sea! Hail to the waves!      8480 
Circled, now, by the sacred blaze! Hail to water! Hail to fire! 
Hail to the rarest sweet desire! 
 
All In Chorus 
 
Hail, the gently flowing breeze! 
Hail, hidden caverns of the seas!      8485 Be honoured now, for evermore, 
You, the Elemental four! Part II Act III Scene I: Before the  Palace of Menelaus in Sparta 
 
(Helen enters with the Chor us of Captive Trojan Women. Panthalis is leader 
of the Chorus .) 
 
Helen 
 
I, Helen the much admi red yet much reviled, 
Come from the shore, wher e recently we landed, 
Still drunk with the violent ro cking of those waves    8490 
That from Phrygian height s on high-arched backs, 
By Poseidon’s favour, and the East Wind’s power, 
Carried us here to the coast of my native land. 
There, below us, beside his bravest soldiers King Menelaus, now, celebrates his return.     8495 
But you, bid me welcome, you, the lofty house 
Tyndareus my father bu ilt when he returned, 
Close by the slope of Pallas Athene’s hill: 
Here, where with Clytem nestra, in sisterhood, I 
And Castor and Pollux, grew and happily played:    8500 You, more nobly adorned than all Sparta’s houses. 
Be greeted by me, you honoured double doors! 
Once, Menelaus the shining bridegroom came To me, through your fri endly inviting portals, 
I, the one singled out from among so many.     8505 
Open to me once more, so  that I might fulfil, 
The King’s command, truly,  as a wife should.  
Let me pass! And let everything be left behind, 
That raged round me, till now, so full of doom. 
For since, light in heart, I left this place behind,    8510 Seeking out Venus’ temple, in sacred duty, 
Where instead a Trojan robber abducted me, 
Many things have happened,  men, far and wide,  
Gladly tell of, though she’s not so glad to hear them, 
Round whom the story grew, and myth was spun.    8515 
 
Chorus 
 
O marvellous woman, don’t disdain 
Inheritance of the noblest estate! For the highest fate’s granted to you alone, 
The glory of beauty that towers above all. 
The Hero’s name sounds his advance,      8520 
And proudly he strides: But he bows down, most stubborn of men, 
Before conquering Beauty, in mind and sense. 
 
Helen 
 
Enough of that! I’m brought  here by my husband, 
I’ve been sent ahead by him, now, to his city:    8525 But what the meaning of it is I can hardly guess. 
Do I come as his wife? Do I come as the Queen? 
Or a sacrifice, for a Prince’s bitter pain, And the ill fortune long endured by the Greeks? 
I’m conquered: but am I a prisoner? I can’t tell!    8530 
True, the Immortals appoi nted Fame, and Fate, 
As the two ambiguous, doubtful companions 
Of Beauty, to stand here at  this threshold with me, 
The gloomy, threatening presences by my side. 
Even in the hollow ship my husband seldom     8535 
Gazed at me, or spoke an encouraging word. 
He sat in front of me, as if in evil thought. But scarcely had the foremo st ship’s prow greeted 
Land, in that deep bay Eurotas’ mouth has made, 
Than he spoke to us, as the gods had urged him:    8540 
‘Here my soldiers will disembark in ordered ranks, I’ll muster them, ranged along the ocean’s-shore: 
But you’ll go on, ever on along the banks 
Of sacred Eurotas, shinin g with bright orchards, 
Guide the horses through glea ming water meadows,   8545 
Till of your lovely jour ney you make an end, 
Where Lacedemon, once a ri ch spreading field, 
Surrounded by austere m ountains, was created. 
Walk through the high-towered house of princes, 
And summon the capable old Stewardess      8550 Along with the maidservants I left behind,  Let her display the store of rich treasure to you, 
That which your father left, and that I myself 
Have added to, amassing it in war and peace. You’ll find it all still in the most perfect order:    8555 
It is a prince’s privilege that he should find 
That all is loyalty, on returning to his house, 
All that he’s left behind still in its proper place. Since no slave has the power to effect a change.’ 
 
Chorus 
 
Let this treasure, so steadily massed,      8560 
Bring you delight, now, in eye and breast! 
For the necklace bright, and the crown of gold, Were resting, and dark ening, in proud repose: 
But enter now, and claim them all, 
They’ll quickly respond.        8565 I love to see Beauty itself compete 
Against gold and pearls and glittering gems. 
 
Helen 
 
So again there came my lord’s imperious speech: 
‘When you’ve examined a ll of it in due order, 
Take as many tripods as you think you’ll need,    8570 
And as many vessels as sacrifice requires, To fulfil the customs of the sacred rites. Take cauldrons, and basi ns, and circular bowls: 
The purest of water from the holy fountains, 
In deep urns: take care that you’ve dry wood too,     8575 Such as will quickly catch fire, and hold all ready: 
And finally don’t forget a well-honed knife: 
Everything else I’ll leave for your decision.’ So he spoke, at the same  time urging my going: 
But he who commanded marked out nothing living    8580 
To be slain: to honour the Olympian gods. Essential, but I’ll think no more about it, 
And leave all things in the hands of the gods: 
They fulfil whatever is in their mind to do, Whether or not we think it good or evil:     8585 In either case we mortals must endure it. 
Often the priest’s heavy axe has been lifted, 
From the bowed neck of the sacrificial victim, So he could not slaughter it, being hindered, 
By enemies near, or the gods’ intervention.     8590 
 
Chorus 
 
What might happen, think not of that: 
Queen, go on, now, step inside, And be brave! Good and evil come 
Unannounced, to Mankind:       8595 
Though it’s proclaimed, we’ll not believe. 
Troy still burned: did we not see 
Death in our faces, shameful death: 
And are we not here, Your friends, happily serving,       8600 
Seeing the blinding sun in the sky 
Seeing the Loveliest on Earth, You, the kind: we the joyous? 
 
Helen 
 
Let it be, as it will! Whatever awaits me, 
I must go, swiftly, up to that royal house,     8605 Long forsaken, often longed for, almost lost, That’s before my eyes once more: I know not how. 
My feet don’t carry me onwards so bravely, now, 
Up those high steps, I sk ipped over as a child. 
 
Chorus 
 
Sorrowful prisoners,        8610 
Oh, cast away, Sisters, 
All your pain, to the winds: Share in your mistress’ joy 
Share now in Helen’s joy, 
Who returns, truly late indeed, To her father’s hearth and home,      8615 But with all the more firm a step, 
Delightedly approaching. 
 Praise the sacred gods, 
Creating happiness,        8620 
Bringing the wanderer home! 
See the freed prisoner Soar on uplifted wings, 
Over harshness, while, all in vain, 
The captives, so full of longing,       8625 Pine away, arms still outstretched,  To the walls of their prison. 
 
But a god snatched her up, then, The far-exiled: 
And from Ilium’s fall,        8630 
Carried her back once more, home To the old, to the newly adorned, her 
Father’s house, 
From unspeakable Rapture and torment,        8635 
Now, reborn, to remember 
The days of her childhood.  
Panthalis  (As leader of the Chorus .) 
 Now leave behind the joyful path of your singing, And turn your eyes towards the open doorway! 
Sisters, what do I see! Surely the Queen returns    8640 
Waking towards us, again, with anxious steps? What is it, great Queen? What can you have met with, 
Within the halls of your house, instead of greetings, 
To cause you such trembling? You can hide nothing, Since I see your reluctance written on your brow,    8645 
And amazement competes there with noble anger. 
 Helen ( Who has left the doors open, in her turmoil .) 
 
A daughter of Zeus is stirred by no common fear, No lightly passing hand of Terror can touch her: Only the Horror that the womb of ancient Night, 
Raised from chaos, and shaped in its many forms,    8650 
In glowing clouds that shoot, upwards and outwards,  From the peak’s fiery throat, to shake the hero’s breast. 
So here today the Stygi an gods have marked 
The entrance to my house w ith terror: and gladly 
I’d take myself far away, lik e a guest let go,     8655 
Far from this often trodden, lo ng yearned for threshold. 
But no! I’ve retreated here now, into the light, 
And you Powers will drive me no further, whoever 
You are. Rather, I’ll thi nk of some consecration, 
So the hearth-fire, cleansed, gr eets the wife, as the lord.   8660 
 
The Leader of the Chorus 
 
Noble lady, reveal to your maidservants here, 
Who help you reverently , what has happened. 
 
Helen 
 
You’ll see what I saw yourselves, with your own eyes, 
If ancient Night has not, stra ight away, swallowed it, 
That shape of hers: withdrawn it to her heart’s depths.   8665 But I’ll picture it to you in words, so you’ll know: 
As, with those recent orders in mind, I trod, 
Gravely, through the palace’s innermost room, Awed by the silence of the gloomy corridors, No sound of busy labour greeting my ears,     8670 
No sound of prompt, diligent effort meeting my eye, 
No Stewardess appeared, and no maidservants, No courtesy such as us ually greets the stranger. 
But as I approached clos er to the hearth stone 
Beside the glowing ashes that remained, I saw    8675 A veiled woman, vast shap e, seated on the floor, 
Not like one who’s asleep, but one deep in thought. 
I summoned her to work, with words of command, Thinking she was the Stewardess whom my husband, 
Had placed there perhaps, with fo resight, when he left.    8680 
But she still sat there, crouched and immoveable: At last, stirred by my threats, she raised her arm, As if she gestured me aw ay from hearth and hall. 
I turned aside from her, angrily, and sped, 
To the steps where the Thalamos is adorned     8685 On high, and close beside it the treasure house: 
Suddenly that strange shape sprang up from the floor, 
Barring my way, imperiously, showing herself, 
Tall and haggard, with hollo w, blood-coloured gaze: 
A shape so weird that mind an d eye were troubled.    8690 
But I talk to the wind: for words weary themselves 
Trying to conjure forms, vainly, like some creator. See for yourselves! She even dares the daylight! Here am I mistress, till the King, my lord, shall come. 
Phoebus, beauty’s friend, drives the horrid spawn of Night  8695 
To caverns underground, or he binds them fast.  
(Phorkyas appears on the threshold, between the doorposts .) 
 
Chorus 
 
Much have I learned, although the locks 
Curl youthfully still across my temples! 
Many the terrible things I’ve seen, 
The soldiers’ misery, Ilium’s night,      8700 When it fell. 
 
Through the clouded, and dust-filled turmoil, The press of warriors, I heard the gods Calling terribly, heard the ringing 
Iron voice of Discord through the field,     8705 
City-wards.  
Ah! They still stood there, Ilium’s 
Walls, but the glow of the flames Soon ran from neighbour to neighbour, 
Ever spreading, hither and thither,      8710 
With the breath of their storm, Over the darkening city. Fleeing, through smoke and heat, I saw 
Amid the tongues of soaring fire, 
The fearful angry presence of gods,      8715 
Marvellous, those striding figures, Like giants, they were, through the gloom, 
The fire-illumined vapour. 
 Did I see that Confusion, Or did the fear-consumed Spirit       8720 
Create it? Never will I be able, 
To say, but I’m truly certain Of this, that here I see, Her, 
Monstrous shape to my eyes: 
My hand could even touch Her,       8725 If terror did not restrain me, 
Saving me from danger. 
 Which of the daughters 
Of Phorkyas are you? 
Since I liken you         8730 To that family. 
 
Are you perhaps one of the Graeae, A single eye and a single tooth, Owned alternately between you, 
One born of greyness?        8735 
 Monster, do you dare 
Here, next to Beauty, 
Show yourself to Phoebus,  And his knowing gaze? 
 
Then step out before him regardless:      8740 Since he’ll not look at what’s ugly, 
Just as his holy eye, 
Has never seen shadow. Yet we mortals are compelled, ah, 
By unfortunate gloomy fate,       8745 
To the unspeakably painful sight 
She, reprehensible, ever ill fated, Provokes in the lover of Beauty. 
 
Yet hear me then, if you boldly Encounter us: hear the curse,       8750 Hear the threat of every abuse, 
From the condemnatory mouth of the fortunate, 
Whom the gods themselves have created.  
Phorkyas (The transformed Mephistopheles .) 
 The saying is old, with meaning noble and true, 
That Beauty and Shame, together, hand in hand,    8755 
Never pursue the same path, over green Earth.  Such ancient, deep-rooted hatred lives in both, 
That whenever they meet , by chance, on the way, 
The one will always turn her back on her rival. 
Then quickly and fiercely each goes on, again,    8760 
Shame downcast, but Beau ty mocking in spirit, 
Till in the end Orcus’ da rk void shall take her, 
If age hasn’t, long before then, tamed her pride. So now I find you, impudent, come from abroad, 
With overflowing arrogance, like the cranes,     8765 
Their noisily croaking ranks, high overhead, Their long cloud, sending its creaking tones, down here, 
Tempting the quiet traveller to look upwards: 
Yet they pursue their way, while he follows his: And that’s the way it will be with us as well.     8770 
What then are you, wild Maenads or Bacchantes, 
That dare to rage round the great royal palace? Who are you, then, who howl at this high house’s 
Stewardess, like a pack of bitches, at the moon? 
Do you think it’s hidden from me what race you are?   8775 You brood, begotten in battle, raised on slaughter, Lusting for men, the seducers and the seduced, 
Draining the soldiers’ and the citizens’ powers! 
To see your crowd’s like watching a vast swarm Of locusts settle here, darkening the fields.     8780 
You the wasters of others labour! Nibbling,  
Destroying, the ripening crops of prosperity! 
Defeated, bartered, sold  in the market, you! 
 
Helen 
 
Who abuses the servants before the mistress, 
Presumptuously usurping a wife’s true rights?    8785 
Only to her is it given to praise whatever’s 
Praiseworthy: and to punish what is at fault. I’m well content, as well,  with all the services 
They provided to me, wh en Ilium’s great might, 
Stood beleaguered, and fell in ru ins: none the less    8790 
Just as we’ve endured the wretched wandering 
Journey, where often one thinks only of oneself, 
So here I expect it now from a happier crew: A lord asks how slaves se rve, not what they are. 
So be silent, then, and no longer jeer at them.    8795 
If you’ve guarded the king’s house well until now, In place of the mistress, such is to your credit: 
But now that she comes hers elf, you should draw back, 
Lest you find punishment instead of fair reward.  
Phorkyas 
 
Disciplining servants is a prerogative      8800 
That the noble wife of a king, loved by the gods, 
Has duly earned by years of wise discretion. 
Since you, acknowledged, ta ke up your former place 
Once more, as Queen, a nd mistress of the house, 
Resume the slackened reins agai n, and rule here,    8805 
Hold the treasure in your keeping, and us with it. But first of all defend me, who am the elder, 
Against this crowd, who if they are compared 
To your swanlike beauty, are only cackling geese. The Leader of the Chorus 
 
How ugly ugliness looks, next to beauty.     8810 
 
Phorkyas 
 
How stupid the lack of reason, next to sense.  (From here on the Chorus answer in  turn, stepping forward one by one .) 
 
First Member of the Chorus 
 
Tell us of Father Erebus: tell us of Mother Night. 
 
Phorkyas 
 
Speak about Scylla, sweet sister of your race. 
 
Second Member of the Chorus 
 
There are plenty of monsters in your family tree. 
 
Phorkyas 
 
Go down to Orcus, look for your tribe down there!    8815 
 
Third Member of the Chorus 
 
Those who are down there are far too young for you. 
 
Phorkyas 
 
Try your arts of seduction on old Tiresias. 
 
Fourth Member of the Chorus 
 
Orion’s nurse was your great great-grandchild. Phorkyas 
 
I suspect that the Harpies raised you all, on filth. 
 
Fifth Member of the Chorus 
 
What do you feed your perfect leanness on?    8820 
 
Phorkyas 
 
Not on the blood that you  all lust so much for. 
 
Sixth Member of the Chorus 
 
You hunger for corpses, you, foul corpse yourself! 
 
Phorkyas 
 
Vampire’s teeth gleam there,  in your shameless muzzle. 
 
The Leader of the Chorus 
 
It would shut yours tight, if I called out who you are. 
 
Phorkyas 
 
Well say your own name first: that’ll solve the riddle.   8825 
 
Helen 
 
I intervene, not in anger but in sorrow, 
To forbid this alternating discord! 
A ruler meets with nothing that’s more harmful Than private disputes of his quarrelling servants. 
Then his firm orders are no longer answered     8830 
With swiftly answering and harmonious action, Instead, wilful commotion roars around him: Self-composure lost, he abuses them in vain. 
Not only that. Unacceptably, in anger, 
You’ve summoned the wretched sh apes of dreadful forms,   8835 They surround me, so I feel I’m being whirled 
To Orcus, from these familiar paternal fields. 
Am I remembering? Did delusion grip me? 
Was I all of that? Am I,  now? And shall be still, 
Symbol of dream and fear, to those who waste cities?   8840 
The maidservants shudder, but you, the eldest, 
Stand there calmly: speak words of reason to me!  
Phorkyas 
 
The favour of the gods seems only a dream 
To one who recalls the troubles of long ages. 
But you, blessed, beyond all aim and measure,    8845 
Quickly inflamed to every sort of daring risk, Only found fires of love, in the realm of life, 
Theseus, driven by lust, abducted you, a child,   
He strong as Hercules: a man nobly formed.  
Helen 
 
He carried me off, a slende r ten-year old fawn,    8850 
And caged me in Aphidn us’ tower in Attica. 
 
Phorkyas 
 
But soon freed, by the hands of Castor and Pollux, 
A crowd of suitors, the heroes, swarmed round you.  
Helen 
 
Yet, I freely confess, above all, Patroclus 
The image of Achilles, had my secret favour,    8855 
 
Phorkyas 
 
But your father’s will bound you to Menelaus, 
The brave sea rover, the defender of his house. 
 Helen 
 
He gave him his daughter, and command of the state. 
Hermione came from our married existence.  
Phorkyas 
 
But while he disputed his right to far off Crete,    8860 
To you, the lonely, came all too handsome a guest. 
 
Helen 
 
Why do you recall that semi-widowhood, 
And all the terrible ruin it caused around me?  
Phorkyas 
 
To me, a free-born Cretan, his same journey 
Brought captivity and years of slavery.     8865 
 
Helen 
 
He ordered you here at once, as Stewardess, 
Entrusting the fortress and his treasure to you.  
Phorkyas 
 
Which you abandoned, for Ilium’s high city, 
And the inexhaustible delights of love. 
 
Helen 
 
Not delights, be sure! All too bitter a sorrow     8870 
Was poured endlessly over my head and breast. 
 
Phorkyas 
 
Yet they say that you appeared in dual form, 
Seen in Troy and, at th e same time, in Egypt.  
 Helen 
 
Don’t confuse my clouded, wandering mind completely. 
To this moment, I don’t know which of them I am.    8875  
Phorkyas 
 
Then they say: Achilles became your companion, 
Came, burning, from the empty realm of shadows! 
He’d loved you before, opposing fate’s command. 
 
Helen 
 
As phantom, I bound myself to a phantom. 
It was a dream, as the tale s themselves tell.     8880 
I fade, now, become a phantom to myself. 
 (She sinks into the arms of the Chorus .) 
 
Chorus 
 
Silence! Silence! 
False-seeing one, false-speaking one, you! Out of the terrible single-toothed Mouth, what might be breathed, so,      8885 
Out of so frightful a throat of horror! 
Now the malevolent, se emingly benevolent, 
Wolf’s anger under the woolly fleece, 
Is more terrible to me than the jaws 
Of the three-headed dog.        8890 We stand here anxiously listening: 
When? How? Where,  will such malice 
Break out now From this predatory monster? 
 
Now rather than friendly words, richly laced     8895 With trust, waters of Lethe, sweet and mild, You stir up all from the past, 
The evil more than the good, 
And instantly darken The gleam of the present        8900 
And also the future’s 
Sweetly glimmering, hopeful dawn. 
 Silence! Silence! 
So the Queen’s spirit, now, 
Almost ready to leave her,       8905 Can still hold, and uphold This, the form of all forms 
On which the sun ever lighted. 
 (Helen has recovered, and stands in the centre again .) 
 
Phorkyas 
 
Shining out from fleeting vapours, comes the sunlight of our day, here, 
That when veiled could so delight us, but in splendour only blinds us. 8910 As the world is open to you, when  you show your lovely face, now, 
Though they scorn me so as ugly, still I know the beautiful. 
 
Helen 
 
I step, trembling, from the abyss th at, in fainting, closed around me, 
And would gladly rest my body, tired and weary are my limbs: 
But it’s proper for a Queen, then, as it is for all about her,   8915 
To be calm, and cour ageous, whatever harm shall threaten. 
 
Phorkyas 
 
In your Majesty, and Beauty, standing here, now, before us, 
Your look says it commands us. What do you command? Speak out. 
 
Helen 
 
Prepare yourselves to atone for what your quarrel has neglected: 
Hurry with your sacrifice, now, as  the king himself commanded. 8920 
   
Phorkyas 
 All is ready in the palace, bowls, and tripods, sharpened axe-blade, 
For the sprinkling, incense burning: show me now the ready victim! 
 
Helen 
 
That the king has failed to tell me. 
 
Phorkyas 
 
     He said nothing? Words of woe! 
 
Helen 
 
What’s this woe that overcomes you? 
 
Phorkyas 
 
          Queen, it means you must be slaughtered! 
 
Helen 
 
I? 
 
Phorkyas  
 And them. 
 
Chorus 
 
  Oh, pain and suffering! 
 
Phorkyas 
 
        You will fall beneath the axe. 8925 
 
 
Helen 
 
Presaged, though still dreadful: I, alas! Phorkyas 
 
       There’s no escaping. 
 
Chorus 
 
Oh! And us? What happens to us?  
Phorkyas 
 
      She will die a noble death, then: But you’ll hang in rows together, st ruggling, all along the rafters 
Holding up the gabled roof there,  as bird-catchers dangle thrushes. 
 (Helena and the Chorus stand stunned and alarmed, in striking composed 
groups .) 
 Phantoms! – Frozen images, you stand, parted    8930 
From that light you can’t belong to, in your terror. 
Men, and the tribe of  phantoms you resemble, 
Will never willingly forgo the sunlight: 
But none are saved from thei r fate, or can defer it. 
All know it’s true, but only a few accept it.     8935 Enough, you’re lost! Now, quickly: start the work.  
(She claps her hands: muffled dwarfish forms appear in the doorway, and 
quickly carry out her orders .) 
 
This way, you spheres, shadowy rounded forms! 
Roll over here: and do what harm you wish. Set up the gold-horned altar that you carry, 
Let the gleaming axe lie there on the silver rim,    8940 
Fill the urns with water to wash away All the hideous stains of darkened blood.  
Spread the rich carpets out, here, over the dust, 
So the sacrifice can kneel in royal manner, And be wrapped around, once the head is severed,    8945 And buried decently there,  and with due honour. The Leader of the Chorus 
 
The Queen stands here besi de us deep in thought, 
The maidservants wither away like mown grass: 
I think that I, as the eldest, am bound, in sacred duty, 
To barter words with you, the eldest of all by far.    8950 
You’re wise, experienced, and seem well-disposed, 
And though this foolish cr owd baited you in error, 
Speak of a way to escape this fate, if you know it. 
 
Phorkyas 
 
That’s easily done: it depends on the Queen alone, 
To save herself, and you her followers with her.    8955 
But decision is required, and of the swiftest. 
 
Chorus 
 
Most honoured of Fates, wisest of Sibyls, you, 
Hold the gold shears apart: bring both aid and light: Already, we feel oursel ves swinging, struggling, 
Fearful, for our limbs would rather be dancing,    8960 
And afterwards rest, soft, on our lovers’ breast.  
Helen 
 
Let them be afraid! I f eel pain but no terror: 
Yet if rescue’s possible, I gladly accept. 
To the wise, far-seeing mind, the impossible 
Is often revealed as possibl e. Speak: say on!     8965 
 
Chorus 
 
Speak, and tell us, tell us quickly: how we might escape the terror, 
Dreadful nooses that still threaten, like some kind of evil necklace 
Wound around our tender necks? Alrea dy we, oh, wretched creatures, 
Feel the choking, suffocating, if  you, Rhea, the great mother 
Of the gods, won’t show us mercy.      8970 Phorkyas 
  
Have you the patience to listen, to long winded 
Speeches, in silence? The history’s endless. 
 
Chorus 
 
Patience enough! While we’re  listening, we’re alive. 
 
Phorkyas 
 
He who stays at home to  guard his noble wealth 
And secures the high walls of his lofty dwelling,    8975 
And maintains his roof against the driving rain, Will prosper in all the days of his long life: 
But whoever, in guilt, cro sses the square-cut stones 
Of the sacred threshold, swiftly, with fleeing steps, Will, indeed find the ancient place, on their return,    8980 
But altered in every way, if not overthrown. 
 
Helen 
 
Why recount these familiar sayings here? 
If you’d relate things: don’t provoke annoyance. 
 
Phorkyas 
 
It’s simple fact, in no way a criticism. 
Menelaus sailed from bay to bay, looting,     8985 
Skirted the coast and islands, aggressively, Returned with the spoils that are rusting there. 
Then he spent ten long years there in front of Troy: 
And I don’t know how many more, on the way home. 
And how are things now with th is place where we stand,   8990 
Tyndareus’ noble house, and the region round? 
 
Helen 
 
Do you embrace all scorn so completely 
You can only open your mouth to criticise?  
Phorkyas 
 
The vales were neglecte d for so many years,  
Those that rise behind Sparta, to the northward,    8995 
Beyond Taygetus, from where, a living stream, 
Eurotas, pours downward, then along our valley, Flows by our broad reed-beds, to feed your swans. Up there, in the mountain vales, a bold race settled, 
Pushing southward from Ci mmerian darkness,    9000 
And then built an inaccessible fortress there, From which, at will, they  harass land and people. 
 
Helen 
 
Have they achieved all th at? It seems unlikely. 
 
Phorkyas 
 
They’ve had time, perhaps twenty years in all. 
 
Helena 
 
Is there a leader? Are they a band of robbers?    9005 
 
Phorkyas 
 
Not robbers, but one of them acts as leader. 
I don’t curse him, though he  attacked me too. 
He might have taken a ll, but was satisfied 
With gifts, not tribut e, as he called them. 
 
Helen 
 
How did he look? 
 
Phorkyas  
     Less than evil! He pleased me well.     9010 
He’s vigorous, daring, and sophisticated,  An intelligent man: as few among the Greeks. 
They call his race Barbarians, but I’m doubtful 
If they are any crueller than those heroes 
Who proved such devourers of men, before Troy.    9015 I respected his greatness, and confided in him. 
His fortress! You should see with your own eyes! 
It’s a great deal more than the clumsy masonry 
Your father rolled toge ther, higgledy-piggledy, 
Cyclopean as a Cy clops, piling raw stone,     9020 
Over raw stone: there, instead there, it’s all 
Plumb line and balance: it’s laid out by rule. Look from outside! It rises straight to the sky, 
So firm, tightly jointed – smooth as a steel mirror 
To climb – that even your thoughts slide off!     9025 And, inside, great courts with plenty of room,  
Ringed by buildings, of every use and nature. 
There you’ll see pillars, co lumns, arches, quoins, 
Balconies, galleries, facing inwards and outwards, 
And coats of arms. 
 
Chorus 
 
   What arms are those?  
 
Phorkyas   
 
                Ajax carried   9030 
A writhing snake on his shield: you yourself saw it. 
The Seven against Thebes also bore their symbols 
On each of their shields,  replete with meaning. 
There you saw moons, and st ars in the night sky, 
Heroes and Goddesses, torche s, ladders, swords,    9035 
And whatever fierce weapons  threaten fine cities. 
Our heroic band carries such images too, 
In bright colours, bestowed by our ancestors. 
There you see lions, eagles with beaks and claws, 
Horns of oxen, wings, roses, and peacocks’ tails,    9040 Bands too made of gold, black, silver, blue and red. 
The like of these hang in their halls, row on row. 
In spacious halls, as wide as the whole wide world: You could dance there! 
 
Chorus 
 
         Say then, are there dancers, there? 
 
Phorkyas 
 
The best! A lively crowd of golden-haired youths.    9045 
The fragrance of youth! Paris was fragrant, thus, 
When he grew close to the Queen.  
Helen 
 
     You mistake your role 
Completely: now speak your closing lines to me! 
 
Phorkyas 
 
No, you speak the last! Grave, and distinct say: Yes! 
And I’ll surround you with that fortress. 
 
Chorus 
 
                      O, speak   9050 
That one short word, and sa ve both yourself, and us! 
 
Helen 
 
What? Do I fear King Menelaus would commit 
Such a cruel offence as to make me kill myself? 
 
Phorkyas 
 
Have you forgotten how he  wreaked mutilation, 
Unheard-of, on Deiphobus, dead  Paris’ brother,    9055 
Because he stubbornly claimed you, the widow, And prized you? He cropped both nose and ears, 
And disfigured him, there: It was terrible to see. 
 Helen 
 
Yes he did that, and he  did it for my sake. 
 
Phorkyas 
 
Because of it, now, he’ll do the same to you.     9060 
Beauty is indivisible: he who owns it Destroys it, rather than share a part of it. 
 
(Trumpets sound in the distance: the Chorus starts in terror .) 
 
As a trumpet call pierces the ear to grip 
And tear the innards: Jealousy drives her claws Into the breast of him who can never forget     9065 
What once he had, and lost, and no longer has. 
 
Chorus 
 
Don’t you hear the trumpets calling? Don’t you see the flash of swords? 
 
Phorkyas 
 
King and master, now be welcome, gladly I’ll offer my account. 
 
Chorus 
 
But, what of us? 
 
Phorkyas  
     In truth, you know that her death’s before your eyes, 
Find your own death there within them: there’s no hope left for you.  9070  
(A Pause .) 
 
Helen 
 
I ponder this simple thing that I might try. 
You are a hostile daemon: I feel it deeply, I’m fearful you’ll still make evil out of good. 
But then, I’ll follow you to that fortress, there: 
I know the rest: but what the Queen might conceal    9075 
Concerning it, mysteriously, in her heart, Be unknown to all. Now, old one, lead the way! 
 
Chorus 
 
O, how gladly we’re going, 
On hurrying feet: 
Death is behind:         9080 Before us again, 
Towering fortress 
Inaccessible walls. Though they guard us as well 
As Ilium’s citadel,         9085 
Still in the end, it Fell, through the basest of ruses. 
 
(Mists rise and spread, obscuring the background, and the nearer part of the 
scene, at will. ) 
 
What is this? How? Sisters, look round! Wasn’t it loveliest day?        9090 
Strips of vapour hover about, 
Rise from Eurotas’ holy stream: Already the loveliest 
Reed-wreathed shore has vanished from sight: 
And the proud, free, graceful       9095 Gentle glide of the swans 
Swimming in sociable joy, 
I alas see, no more!  
Yet still, still 
I hear them calling,        9100 In hoarse tones, calling afar! Proclaiming death, they are speaking. 
Ah, that to us they may not,  
Instead of salvation promised, Proclaim our ruin, at last:        9105 
To us, the swanlike, long, 
Lovely, white-thr oated, and ah! 
Our Queen born of the swan. Woe to us, woe! 
 
All’s hidden already        9110 Vapour’s swirling around. Now we can’t see one another! 
What’s happening? Are we moving? 
  
We’re hovering with 
Straggling steps along the ground?      9115 Can’t you see? Isn’t that Hermes  
Soaring ahead? Doesn’t his gold wand gleam, 
Beckoning us, ordering us back again To the wholly joyless, and greyly-twilit, 
Intangible, phantom-filled,       9120 
Overcrowded, ever-empty Hades?  
Yes, at once, now, all is darkeni ng, dully all the vapours vanish, 
Grey with gloom, and brown as walls . Walls appearing to our vision, 
Blank now to our clearer vision. A court now is it? Or a deep pit? 
Fearful, though, in either case, now! Sisters, oh! We are imprisoned, 9125 
Captives, as we’ve never been. Part II Act III Scene II: The Inner Court of The Castle 
 
(Surrounded with richly ornamente d buildings of the Middle Ages .) 
 
The Leader of the Chorus 
 
Hasty and foolish, and typical of womankind! They hang on the moment, sport of every breeze, Of every chance and mi schance, never knowing 
How to suffer either calmly! One’s always certain,    9130 
Fiercely, to contradict the others, others her: Only, they laugh or cry alike, in joy or pain. 
Now, hush! And listen to what our high-minded  
Mistress may decide, here, for herself and us.  
Helen 
 
Pythoness, where are you? However you’re named:   9135 
Come out from the arches of this dark fortress. 
If you come from the wondrous lord and hero To announce me, and rea dy a fit reception, 
Accept my thanks, and l ead me there quickly: 
I wish my wanderings ended. I want to rest.     9140 
 
The Leader of the Chorus 
 
Queen, in vain, you look about in all directions: 
That wretched shape has vanished, stayed perhaps 
There in the vapour, out of whose depths we came, 
I cannot tell how, so swiftly, without a footfall. Perhaps she wanders lost in the vast labyrinth    9145 
Of these many castles wondrously merged in one. 
Seeking high and princely greeting from her lord. But see! There a crowd moves about in readiness. 
Along galleries, at windows, through the doors 
Come a crowd of servants, scurrying to and fro:    9150 It proclaims a noblest welcome for the guest. Chorus 
 
My heart is eased! O, see over there, 
How a company of hands ome youths approach 
With lingering step, in dignified order, 
Marching in ranks. Who gave  out the command    9155 
To marshal them, and so quickly arranged 
All this youthful team of so handsome a race? 
What shall I admire most? Is it the graceful step, 
Or the curls of hair on the palest of brows, 
Or the rounded cheeks with a peach’s blushes,    9160 And like it also, in their silkiest down? 
I’d gladly bite, yet I’m frightened to try it: 
Since in a similar case, and I shudder to say it, 
The mouth was as suddenly filled, with ashes! 
 
But the handsomest        9165 Come to us now: 
What do they carry? 
Steps for the throne, Carpets and seat, 
Curtain, canopy,         9170 
Jewelled finery: Waving above us, Forming a garland, 
Over the head of our Queen: 
For she, already, invited        9175 Ascends, to the noble seat. 
Forward now, 
Step by step, Solemnly ranked. 
Worthy, O worthy, triply worthy,      9180 
Let such a reception be blessed!  
(What the Chorus has described takes place. After the boys and squires have 
descended in long procession, Faus t appears above, at the top of the 
staircase, in the costume of a knight  of the Middle Ages, and then descends 
slowly and with dignity .) The Leader of the Chorus (Observing him closely .) 
 
If indeed the gods have not, as they often do, 
Only lent this man brave form, for an instant, Exalted his dignity, and charming presence, 
As a temporary act, then whatever he does     9185 
He’ll succeed, whether it’s warring with men, Or in the lesser struggles with lovely ladies. Truly I prefer him to hosts of others, 
Whom my eyes have seen, the highly praised. 
I see the Prince approach, with slow solemn step,    9190 Restrained by reverence: Queen, turn towards him! 
 
Faust  (Approaching: a man in chains at his side .) 
 
Instead of the usual calm greeting 
Instead of a reverential welcome, Here I bring a wretch bound fast with chains, 
Who failed so in his duty, I failed mine.     9195 
Kneel here, so this noble lady May hear a prompt confession of your guilt. 
This, royal Mistress, is the man selected 
Because of his keen vision to gaze about From the high tower, and to look keenly At heaven’s spaces, and the br eadth of earth,     9200 
To report whatever moves here or there, 
From the encircling hills, to the castle, Whether a transit of the woolly flocks, 
Or soldiers: so we can protect the first, 
Attack the others. Today, negligence!      9205 You came here: he had nothing to report: 
We failed in the re ception you deserved, 
In honour of the guest. Now he forfeits His guilty life, and would ha ve shed his blood    9210 
In a merited death: but only you alone 
Shall pardon him or punish, as you wish.  
Helen 
 
Such great power you choose to grant me,  As judge, as Mistress too, though, I suspect 
You intend it as a kind of test –       9215 
Yet, I’ll employ a judge’s first duty, To give the accused a hearing. Speak out.  
Lynceus, the Warden of the Tower 
 
Let me kneel, and let me see her, 
Let me live, or let me die, 
Already I’m devoted to her       9220 Heavenly lady from on high. 
 
Waiting for the dawn’s advances, Gazing at her eastern house, 
Suddenly the sunlight dances, 
Marvellously in the south!       9225  
Drawn to see the marvel closer, 
Instead of the ravine and height, Instead of earth and heaven there, I gazed at her, the sole delight. 
 
I was granted powers of vision       9230 Like the lynx, high in the tree: 
But now I peered in indecision 
As in a dark and clouded dream.  
How think? Even if I’d so wished? 
Wall, and tower? Bolte d gate?       9235 
Mist, it rose, and cleared the mist, 
Came the Goddess here in state! I surrendered heart and eye 
Drinking in the gentle light: 
How that beauty blinds, and I       9240 
Was blinded wholly by the sight.  
I forgot the watchman’s duty, 
And the promised trumpet call: Threaten then, now, to destroy me – Anger lies in Beauty’s thrall.       9245 
 
Helen 
 
I cannot punish this evil that I brought here,  
With me. Ah me! What a fierce fate it is Pursues me, so that everywhere I possess 
The hearts of men, and that they neither spare 
Themselves nor anything else of worth.     9250 They steal, seduce, fight: rushing to and fro, 
Demigods, heroes, gods, even daemons 
Led me in my wanderi ngs, here and there. 
Alone I’ve confused the world, doubly so: 
Now I bring threefold, fourfold woe on woe.     9255 
Take this innocent away: let him go. It’s no shame to be deceived by the gods.   
Faust 
 
O Queen, amazed, I see them both together: 
The certain archer, a nd the stricken prey: 
I see the bow, from which the shaft was loosed,    9260 
That wounded him. Arrow after arrow, 
Now strikes me. Imagining the feathered whirr 
Of arrows crossing every court and hall. What am I now? My walls you make unsafe 
My most faithful servants, you make rebels,     9265  
Already I fear my army too obeys A victorious and unconquered lady. What’s left to do but add myself as well, 
And all that I have vainly imagined mine? 
Freely and loyally, before your feet,      9270 Let me acknowledge you as Mistress, 
Whose presence wins you throne and ownership. 
 
Lynceus (Carrying a chest, with men bringing others .) 
 
Queen, once more I advance! 
The rich man begs a glance, He sees you and at a glimpse,       9275 He’s a beggar, and a prince. 
 
What am I now? What was I once? What’s to be willed? What’s to be done? 
What use the eye’s clearest sight! 
It glances from your royal might.      9280  
From the Eastwards we pressed on, 
And suddenly the West were gone. So wide and long the people massed, 
The first knew nothing of the last. 
 The first rank fell: the next stood fast,      9285 
The third ranks’ lances unsurpassed: 
Each man was like a hundredfold, Thousands died there, all untold.  
We pressed forwards: we stormed on, 
We were masters, then were gone:      9290 And where I ruled as chief today, 
Tomorrow robbed, and stole away. 
 We looked – and rapid was that look: 
The loveliest women there we took, 
We took the oxen from the stall,      9295 We took the horses, took them all. 
 
But my delight was to discover The rarest things I could uncover: And what other men might grasp, 
To me was only withered grass.       9300 
 I was on the trail of treasure, 
Whatever my sharp eye could measure, 
In every pocket I could see, 
Every chest was glass to me.  
Heaps of gold, they were mine,       9305 
And the noblest gems I’d find: Yet now the emeralds alone Are worthy to adorn your throne. 
 
Sway there now ‘twixt ear and lip, You pearly spheres from oceans deep:      9310 
A place the rubies dare not seek, 
So pale beside your rosy cheek.  
And so the riches, every prize, 
I set down here before your eyes: Before your feet I gladly yield,       9315 
The spoils of many a bloody field. 
 As many chests as I’ve brought you, 
I’ve many iron caskets too: 
Let me follow your path still And your treasure chambers fill.      9320  
You’d scarcely mounted to the throne, 
When all bowed down, to you alone, Wisdom, riches, worldly power, 
Before your grace, that very hour. 
 I held it all fast: that is true       9325 
But now it’s loosed, and all for you. 
I thought its worth was plain to see, But now it’s nothing much, to me. 
 
Everything I’ve owned will pass From me like mown and withered grass.     9330 O, give me just one brightening glance, 
And all the value’s in its dance! 
 Faust 
 
Quickly, remove the heap that boldness won, 
And take no blame for it,  but seek no praise. 
All is hers already, that the castle      9335 
Hides in its lap: you offer these few things  
In vain. Go and pile treasure on treasure, In due order. Prese nt a fine array 
Of unseen splendours! Let the vaulted halls 
Gleam like the clearest sky, let Paradise     9340 
Be created from their dead existence. Quickly let flowery carpet on carpet 
Be unrolled beneath her foot: she’ll step 
On softest ground: and let her noble gaze, Blinding all but the Gods, fall on splendour.     9345 
 
Lynceus 
 
What the lord commands is nothing, 
For the servants, a mere plaything: This exalted beauty rules 
Over blood and treasure too. 
The whole army now is tamed,       9350 All the swords are blunt again, Near this form of noble gold, 
The sun itself is pale and cold, 
Near the riches of her face All is but an empty space.       9355 
 
Helen (To Faust .) 
 
I wish to speak to you, come here then 
Beside me! For the empty place invites Its lord, and so secures this place for me. Faust 
 
First, let my loyal dedication please you, 
While I kneel, noble lady: let me kiss      9360 The gracious hand that lifts me to your side. 
Confirm me as co-regent of a realm 
Of unknown borders, win now for yourself Protector, slave, worshipper all in one!  
Helen 
 
So many wonders do I see, and hear      9365 
Amazement grips me, there’s much I would know. 
But teach me why th at man spoke aloud 
With curious speech, familiar but strange. 
Each sound seeming to give way to the next, 
And when a word gave pleas ure to the ear,     9370 
Another came, as if to caress the first. 
 
Faust 
 
If my people’s speech already pleases you, 
O, you’ll be delighted with our singing: It completely satisfies the heart and mind. But to be sure of it, we’ll practise too:      9375 
Alternate speech entices, calls it, forth. 
 
Helen 
 
You’ll tell me how to speak with lovely art? 
 
Faust 
 
It’s easy, it must pour forth from the heart. 
And if the breast then overflows with yearning, 
One looks around and asks –  
Helen 
 
             - who else is burning.    9380  
Faust 
 
Not backwards, forwards is the spirit’s sight, 
This moment now, alone, – 
 
Helen 
 
         -   is our delight. 
 
Faust 
 
She’s treasure and commitment, wealth and land: 
What confirmation does she give –  
Helen 
 
 
        –  my hand. 
 
Chorus 
 
Who’s offended that our Princess      9385 
Grants the master of the castle A show of friendliness? 
Let’s confess, that we’re as fully 
Prisoners, as we’ve been till now Since the shameful overthrow       9390 
Of Ilium, and the anxious, 
Sad, and labyrinthine voyage.  
Women, used to men’s desires, 
Are not particular, They are proficient.        9395 
And they award an equal right 
To shepherds with their golden hair, Dark, fauns perhaps, bristling there, As opportunity affords, 
To bodies in their vigour.        9400 Already they sit closer, closer, 
Drawn towards each other, 
Shoulder to shoulder, knee to knee, 
Hand in hand they sway Across the thrones’        9405 
Soft cushioned, majesty. 
Their private raptures Revealed so boldly To the eyes of the people.       9410 
 
Helen 
 
I feel so far away and yet so near, 
And gladly say now: ‘Here, I am! Here!’ 
 
Faust 
 
I scarcely breathe, I tremble, speech is dead: 
This is a dream: time and place have fled. 
 
Helen 
 
I seem exhausted, yet cr eated new,      9415 
Enmeshed with you, the unknown and the true.  
Faust 
 
Don’t seek to analyse so rare a fate! 
Our duty is to live: though but a day. 
 Phorkyas  (Entering suddenly .) 
 
Spell the letters in love’s primer, Only loving, pass your time here,      9420 
Passing, let love be sublime here, 
But the moment isn’t right. Don’t you feel it, this dark presage? Don’t you hear the trumpet’s message? 
Your destruction is in sight.       9425 
Menelaus with his army Is advancing on you quickly, 
Arm yourself, for bitter fight! 
Overwhelmed by the winners, 
And defiled, like Deiphobus,       9430 You’ll all pay, for this delight. 
First the lighter vessels shatter, 
Then, for this one, at the altar, The newly sharpened axe shines bright.  
Faust 
 
Rash disturbance! Insistent, sh e comes pushing in here:   9435 
Senseless haste is wrong, ev en where there’s danger. 
Unlucky news makes the fairest messenger ugly: 
You, ugliest of all, bring only bad news gladly. 
But you’ll not succeed for once: disturb the air  
With your empty breath. There’ s no danger looming here,  9440 
Your danger’s only an idle threat to me. 
 
(Calls, and explosions from the towers, trumpets and cornets, martial music. 
A powerful army marches past .) 
 
No! Now you’ll see the heroes gather, The whole wide la nd will here unite: 
He deserves the ladies’ favour, 
Who, in their defence, shall fight.      9445 
 (To the leaders, who step forwar d from the ranks, and advance .) 
 
Rage silently, and do your duty, Then you’ll achieve the victory, 
You, the prime of northern beauty, 
You, the flower of the east.  
Cased in steel, with steel gleaming,      9450 
The army shatters realms at will, They appear: the earth is shaking, They advance, it echoes still.  At Pylos, once, we came to shore, 
Old Nestor is no longer living,       9455 
Our independent army saw 
Us shatter all the mighty kings.  
From these walls, in an instant, 
Send Menelaus back to sea: There robbing, killing, is his errand,      9460 As is his wish and destiny. 
 
Dukes, I greet you every one, Commanded by the Spartan Queen: 
At her feet lay vale and mountain, 
Win the kingdoms in between.       9465  
Germans, with your walls and towers, 
Defend Corinth and her bays! Then Achaia’s hundred gorges 
I’ll trust to you, the Goths, always. 
 Let the Franks advance on Elis,       9470 
Messene, to the Saxons brave, 
Normans, hold the Argolis, Rule the shore: and rule the wave.  
When everyone has his own land, 
At foreign foes, let force be aimed,      9475 While Sparta holds the high command  
Our Queen’s ancestral domain. 
 She’ll behold you each, delighting 
In lands, possessed of every right: 
And at her feet you’ll seek her blessing,     9480 Acknowledgement, and law and light. 
 
(Faust descends from the throne: the Princes form a circle round him to 
receive individual commands and instructions .) Chorus 
 
Who wants the loveliest for himself, 
First, above everything, Would be wise to have weapons about him: 
He might well gain by flattery       9485 
Whoever is noblest on Earth: But he won’t possess her in peace: The sly, and insidious tempt her from him, 
Robbers will boldly steal her from him: 
He must prepare to foil them.       9490  
So I praise our Prince the while, 
And think him nobler than the rest, Since he combines wisdom and strength, 
So that the powerful show obedience, 
Waiting his every command.       9495 They follow his orders faithfully, 
Each as much for his own profit 
As for the ruler’s reward and thanks, Winning the highest fame for both. 
 
Who now will drag her away       9500 From the powerful possessor? She belongs to him: let her be his, 
Doubly bestowed by us, so she 
And he, are surrounded inside by thick walls, Outside, by the greatest of armies.      9505 
 
Faust 
 
The gifts that, on those here, I bestow – 
To each of them a prosperous land – Are great and glorious, let them go! 
We in the middle take our stand. 
 In their rivalry they’ll protect you      9510 Half-island ringed by leaping waves, 
While these slender hills connect you 
To Europe’s last great mountain range.  
This land, that outshines every land, 
Be blessed for every race forever,      9515 
Delivered to my Queen’s command, That, long ago now, wondered at her, 
 
There, by Eurotas’ whispering light, She broke radiant from the shell, That brightness dazzling the sight      9520 
Of siblings: Leda’s eyes, as well. 
 This land now turns to you alone, 
Offering you its noblest flower: 
Oh, though the whole world is your own, Let your country hold you in its power!     9525 
 
And though you may endure the sun’s cold arrow Up there, on the mountain’s jagged height, 
See, how the rocky hillside’s green below, now, 
Where the goat may crop its meagre right.  
The sources leap, all streams rush down as one,    9530 
Gorge, slope, and mea dow are already green. 
On a hundred hills, rock-folded, steep and broken, The scattered woolly flocks are clearly seen. 
 
Spread all around, with cautious measured stride, The horned cattle tread the dizzy edge:     9535 
But here there’s shelter that the caves provide, 
Hundreds to hide them all, on the rocky ledge.  
Pan guards them too: and lively nymphs live there, 
In the damp fresh space of bushy clefts, And, yearning upward to the higher air,     9540 
The crowded tree its slender branches lifts. Primeval woods! The mighty oaks their cap: 
Whose stubborn boughs stick out from them, in state: 
While kindly maples, pregnant with sweet sap, 
Soar cleanly upward, toying with the weight.     9545  
Pure mother’s milk, in that still realm of shadows, 
Flows rich, in readiness for lamb and child: Fruit’s not lacking, gift of fertile meadows, And from the hollow trunk drips honey mild. 
 
Here well-being’s granted all the race,      9550 
Cheek and lips both to joy consent, 
Each one is immortal, in their place: 
And all there are healthy and content.  
And thus the lovely child, of purest days,  
Grows, and achieves his father’s strength.     9555 We’re amazed, the question’s still, always: 
Are these gods, or are they truly men? 
 When Apollo took a shepherd’s form, 
The fairest of them was like the sun: 
Since, where pure Nature is the norm,      9560 Then all the worlds must move as one.  
(Taking his seat beside her .) 
 So, this have you, and this have I achieved: 
Let the past fade behind us: it is gone! 
Oh, know yourself from hi ghest gods conceived, 
To the first world, alone then, you belong.     9565 
 
No solid fortresses shall ring you round! In eternal youth, stands as it stood – 
So our stay with all delight be crowned – 
Arcadia in Sparta’s neighbourhood. Lured here to tread this blessed ground,     9570 
You fled towards a happy destiny! 
Let our thrones as arbours now be found, 
Our joy be Arcadian, and free!  
(The scene is completely transformed . Bowers are built against a range of 
rocky caverns. A shadowy grove r uns to the foot of the rocks that rise on all 
sides. Faust and Helen are not visible:  the Chorus lie scattered about in 
sleep .) 
 
Phorkyas 
 
I’m not sure how long these women have been sleeping: 
Nor do I know whether they allowed themselves     9575 To dream  what I saw clearly with my own eyes.   
Therefore I’ll wake them . The young will be amazed, 
You bearded ones, too, who sit waiting there, below, 
To understand the meaning of these wonders. 
Wake! Wake, and shake the dew from your hair,    9580 
The slumber from your eyes! Don’t blink so, but hear me!  
Chorus 
 
Tell us, quickly, quickly, all th e wonders that have happened! 
If we can’t believe them, we’ll en joy them with more pleasure. 
For we’re wholly weary sitting, staring at these empty stones. 
 
Phorkyas 
 
You’ve hardly rubbed your eyes, yet you’re already weary, children? 9585 
Well, listen: in these caverns, in these grottos, in these arbours, 
Shade and shelter have been gran ted, to the two idyllic lovers, 
Our Master and our Mistress.  
Chorus 
 
    What, within there? 
 
Phorkyas 
                      Sweetly sundered, 
From the world, alone they summoned me to grant them quiet service. 
At their side I stood there, honoured, yet still, as one who’s trusted, 9590 
Always gazed at something other, turning here and there at random. 
Looked for roots and bark and mosses,  being skilled in all the potions, 
And so they were left alone. 
 
Chorus 
 
You speak as if a whole world’s sp ace were hidden there inside, now, 
Woods and fields and lakes and ri vers: what a fantasy you spin!  9595 
 
Phorkyas 
 
It’s true: you’re inexperienced , and its depths are unexplored! 
I felt, lost in contemplation, hall on hall there, court on court. 
In an instant laughter echoes, through the cavernous recesses: 
There I see a boy is springing, from his mother to his father, 
From his father to his mother, a ll is dandling and caressing,  9600 
And a foolish, a fond teasing, shouts of play, and cries of joy, Alternate, there, and I’m deaf. 
A naked wingless Spirit, like a faun, and yet no creature, 
Leaps across the solid floor, and the ground beneath responding, Sends him flying through the ether, till the second leap or so, there, 9605 He can touch the cavern roof. 
Anxiously his mother’s calling: ‘Leap as often as you like, dear, 
But all flying is forbidden, so beware of taking flight.’ And his loyal father warns him: ‘In the earth’s the power of swiftness, 
That will quickly send you flying: touch the ground then with your toe, 9610 
And like that son of Earth’s, Antaeus, you’ll soon find strength again.’ So he leaps the rocky masses of  the cavern, from a cornice, 
To another and around then, as a ball does when it’s thrown. 
But suddenly he’s vanished in a crevice of the cavern, And it seems he’s lost. His mother gr ieves for him, father comforts, 9615 
I stand there, wondering anxiously,  but there again’s the vision! 
Do buried treasures lie there? Robe s embroidered all with flowers, 
He has fittingly assumed. Tassels tremble from his shoulders , ribbons flutter round his chest, 
In his hand a golden lyre, like a miniature Apollo,    9620 
He steps happily to the overhanging brink: amazing. And the parents in delight clasp each other to their hearts, 
What’s that shining round his temples? It’s hard to see what’s gleaming, 
Is it gold and gems, or flames, now, of the spirit’s supreme power? 
So he moves as if the stately boy’s proclaimed to us already  9625 The future Lord of Beauty, in whose members the eternal 
Melodies are stirring: and so you too will also hear him, 
And you too will also see him, with  the rarest show of wonder. 
 
Chorus 
 
Do you call this a marvel, 
Crete has begotten?        9630 
Can you never have listened 
To what Poetry teaches? Have you never once heard Ionia’s, 
Have you never listened to Hellas’ 
Most ancient of legends        9635 Of the gods and heroes? 
 
All things that happen In this present age, 
Are mournful echoes 
Of our ancestors’ nobler times:       9640 And your story can’t equal That, loveliest of lies, 
Easier to believe than Truth, 
That they sang of Maia’s son.  
That delicate and strong, yet       9645 
Scarcely born, suckling child, Would you swaddle him in purest down, 
Clothe him in costly jewelled bindings, 
The crowd of chattering nurses’ Utterly senseless notion.        9650 
 
But strong and yet delicate,  Already the supple rascal, Draws forth his lithe body, 
Leaves behind that royal, 
But timid, constraining shell,       9655 Silent, there, in its place: 
 
Like the finished butterfly, 
From the chilly chrysalis, Slipping, with quick unfolding wings, 
Boldly into the sunlit air,        9660 
And courageously fluttering. So did he, the liveliest,  
And he quickly demonstrated 
By the most skilful arts, That he’d always be the patron       9665 
Daemon of thieves and jesters 
And all seekers of profit.  
From the Sea God he quickly stole 
His trident, and from Ares himself, Slyly, his sword from its scabbard:      9670 
Bow and arrows from Phoebus too, 
And tongs from Hephaestus:  
He even stole Father Zeus’  
Lightning bolts, not scared of fire: Then he tripped poor Eros up,       9675 In the toils of a wrestling match: 
As Venus kissed him, too, stole away, 
The ribbons from her breasts.  
(A pure melodious and exquisite music echoes from the cave. All listen and 
appear deeply moved. There is a full mu sical accompaniment from this point 
to the designated pause .) Phorkyas 
 
Hear the loveliest of music, 
Free from old mythology!       9680 All your gods and all their antics,  
Let them go, they’re history. 
 None can understand you more, We demand a higher art: 
From the heart itself must pour,       9685 
What will influence the heart.  
(She retires towards the rocks .) 
 Be you stirred, you awesome being, 
By the sweet and flattering sound, 
We, renewed to life, are feeling, Moved to tears of joy, around.       9690 
 
Let the sun be lost from heaven So it’s daylight in the soul, 
We’ll discover in the heart, then, 
What the Earth fails to hold.  (Helen. Faust. Euphorion, in co stume as previously described .) 
 
Euphorion 
 
Hear the song of childhood sung now,      9695 
Its delight belongs to you, See me leap about in time, now  
Let my parents’ hearts leap too. 
 
Helen 
 
It requires two noble hearts 
For Love to bless humanity,       9700 But to be a thing apart 
They must make a precious three. 
 Faust 
 
All we sought is now discovered: 
I am yours, and you are mine: And we two are bound together,      9705 
There’s no better fate to find. 
 
Chorus 
 
They’ll delight for many years 
In this child’s tender glow, Ah, this partnership of peers, 
How it’s beauty moves me, so!       9710 
 
Euphorion 
 
Now let me leap, oh, 
Now let me spring! 
High in the air, go 
Circling all things, That’s the desire         9715 
That’s driving me on. 
 
Faust 
 
Yet, gently! Gently! 
Not into danger, Lest a chance downfall, 
Awaits the ranger,         9720 
Straight away grounds you, Our darling son! 
 
Euphorion 
 
I can’t stick fast to 
The ground any more: Let go my hands and        9725 Let go my hair, 
Let go my clothes! 
They are all mine.  
Helen 
 
O think! Please think, 
Whom you belong to!        9730 
How it would grieve us, 
How you’d destroy too, That sweet achievement, Yours, his and mine. 
 
Chorus 
 
I fear this unity         9735 
Soon will unwind!  
Helen and Faust 
 
Calm yourself! Calm excess, 
To please your parents, 
Too great a liveliness, Impulsive violence!        9740 
In rural peacefulness, 
Brighten the plain.  
Euphorion 
 
If that’s what you wish, yes, 
I’ll stop, I’ll restrain. 
 
(He winds, dancing, through the chor us and draws them along with him .) 
 
I’ll hover here, lightly        9745 
Lively the crew. Is this the melody, 
And measure too? Helen 
 
Yes that is neatly done: 
Lead all the fairest on,        9750 Through intricacy. 
 
Faust 
 
Would it were over then! 
Such entertainment 
Won’t delight me.  
Chorus  (With Euphorion, dancing nimbly and singing, in interlinking 
ranks .) 
 
When your arms equally        9755 
Are charmingly lifted, Your curling hair’s brightly  
Loosened and shifted. 
 When with a foot so light 
Over the earth in flight,        9760 
Thither and back again, Step upon step, you rain,  
Then your goal is in sight, 
Loveliest child: All of our hearts, beguiled,       9765 
With yours unite.  
 (Pause .) 
 
Euphorion 
 
You’re like so many 
Light-footed fawns: Now to new games we Are quickly re-born!        9770 
I’ll be the hunter, 
You be the prey.  
Chorus 
 
If you would catch us 
Don’t be so eager, 
We too are anxious        9775 
When all is over, To clasp the form, You so sweetly display! 
 
Euphorion 
 
Now through the vale! 
Up hill and down dale!        9780 What I gain easily 
Is tedious to see, 
Only what’s forcibly Won delights me. 
 
Helen and Faust 
 
How wild he is now! And how stubborn!     9785 
There’s little hope of moderation. That’s the sound of blowing horns, Through the woods and valley ringing: 
What noise, and what confusion! 
 Chorus (Entering one by one, in haste .) 
 
He is running from us swiftly:       9790 Scorning us and always mocking, 
Now he drags one from the crowd: she, 
The wildest of us all. 
 
Euphorion (Dragging along a young girl .) 
 Here I’ll drag the little quarry, To enforce my wish entirely:       9795 
For my joy, and my desire, 
Press her wilful heart, on fire, Kiss her stubborn mouth at length 
And proclaim my will and strength. 
 
The Girl 
 
Let me go! Since there’s a strong       9800 
Resistant spirit in this body: My will, like yours, if I’m not wrong, Says I’m not taken easily. 
 
You think I’m in any danger? Force of arms is it, you claim!       9805 
Hold me fast, you foolish ranger, 
And I’ll scotch your little game.  
(She turns to flame and flashes into the air .) 
 Follow me through flowing air, 
Follow me through caverns bare, 
Catch your fleeing prey again!       9810  
Euphorion  (Shaking off the flames .) 
 Rocks all around me here, Deep in the forest view, 
Make me a prisoner, 
Though I’m still young and new.  
Breezes are blowing fair,        9815 
Waves now are breaking there: I hear both far away, 
I’d gladly be there today. 
 (He leaps further up the rocks .) 
 
Helen, Faust and the Chorus 
 
A chamois you’d imitate? 
We’re fearful of your fate.       9820 Euphorion 
 
Ever higher I must climb. 
Ever further I must see.  
Now I know where I stand! 
Amidst this semi-island, Amidst Pelop’s country,        9825 Earth – kindred to the sea. 
 
Chorus  
Why not live here, in peace, 
Among hills and groves? Vines then for you we’ll seek,       9830 
Vines in their rows. 
 Vines on high ridges stand, 
Figs, there, and apples gold, 
Stay in this lovely land Stay, and grow old!  
 
Euphorion 
 
Do you dream of peaceful days?      9835 
Dream, then as dreamers may. 
War is the watchword though. Victory! It rings out so. 
 
Chorus 
 
He who in time of peace 
Wishes for war, soon        9840 Witness’s the decease, 
Of hope, and fortune. 
 
Euphorion 
 
Those who made this land, 
With danger on every hand, Free, and courageously,        9845 
Gave their blood lavishly: 
 
Bring holy meaning To that sacrifice – 
See us still conquering 
All whom we fight!        9850  
Chorus 
 
Look up there, how high he climbs! 
Yet he seems to us no smaller: 
In his armour, as in triumph, 
How he gleams in steel and silver.  
Euphorion 
 
Each one’s no longer conscious       9855 
Of the high wall, or the rest: 
Since the one enduring fortress, Is the soldier’s iron breast. 
 
If you’d live unconquered, Quickly arm, and fight the real foe:      9860 Every wife an Amazon bred, 
And every child a hero. 
 
Chorus 
 
Sacred Poetry 
Climbing, and heavenly! 
Shines there, the fairest star,       9865 
Far there, and still so far! And yet it reaches here, 
Always, and still we hear, 
Joy, where we are. Euphorion 
 
No, not as a child do I appear,       9870 
This youth comes armed, you see: In spirit he’s already a peer, 
Of the strong, the bold, and free. 
Now I go! Now, and lo,         9875 The path to glory shines for me. 
 
Helen and Faust 
 
You’ve scarcely been called to being, 
Scarcely come to daylight’s gleam, And from the heights you’re yearning, 
For the place of pain, it seems.       9880 
Are we two Naught to you? 
Is the sweetest bond a dream? 
 
Euphorion 
 
Don’t you hear the thundering wave? Through vale on vale the echoes call,      9885 Host on host, in sand and spray, 
Shock on shock, in anguished fall. 
Understand The command 
Is death, now and for all.        9890 
 
Helen, Faust and the Chorus 
 
What horror! What disaster! 
Is then death ordained for you? Euphorion 
 
Should I watch it from afar? 
No! I’ll share their trouble too.  
Helen, Faust and the Chorus 
 
Exuberance, danger,        9895 
Deadliest fate! 
 
Euphorion 
 
Yes! – I am winged here, 
I will not wait! Onward! I must! I must! 
Let me but fly!         9900 
 (He hurls himself into the air: his cl othes bear him a moment, his head is 
illuminated and a streak of light follows .) 
 
Chorus 
 
Icarus! Icarus! 
No more! We sigh.  
(A beautiful youth falls at the parents’ feet. We imagine we see a well-known 
form in the dead body, but the physical part vanishes at once, while an 
aureole rises like a comet to heaven. The clothes, cloak and lyre remain on 
the ground .) 
 
Helen and Faust 
 
At once, joy is followed,  By bitterest pain. 
 
Euphorion  (From the depths .) 
 Mother, don’t leave me alone,       9905 
In the shadows’ domain! 
 (Pause ) 
 
Chorus (Dirge .) 
 Not alone! – No matter where you are, 
For we believe in following you: 
Oh! Though from the day you part, Not one heart will part from you.      9910 We scarcely wish to mourn you, even, 
We sing in envy of your fate: 
To you the clearest light of heaven, Gave song and courag e, true and great. 
 
Ah! You were born for earthly fate,      9915 High descent and supreme power: 
Youth, sadly, while you went astray, 
Was torn from you in its first hour! You saw the world, with clearer vision, 
You understood the yearning heart,      9920 
The glow of lovely woman’s passion, And all singing’s rarest art. 
 
Yet, irresistibly, you ran free, In nets of indiscipline: you Divorced yourself violently,       9925 
From custom, and from rule: 
Until at last, through thinking deeper, You gave courage greater weight, 
And wished to win to splendour, 
But that could not be your fate.       9930  
Whose then? – The gloomy question, 
That destiny itself conceals, While in days unblessed by fortune, 
Our people’s silent blood congeals.  
But new songs will refresh them,      9935 No longer bow them to the floor, The earth shall see them once again, 
As it saw them once before. 
 (A complete Pause. The music ends .) 
 
Helen (To Faust .) 
 Alas, the ancient word proves true for me, as well: 
That joy and beauty never lastingly unite.     9940 
The thread of life, as the thread of love, is torn: 
Painfully, lamenting both, I must say: farewell, And enter your embrace, once, and then no more. 
Persephone, receive me, a nd this child of ours! 
 (She embraces Faust: her body vanish es, her dress and veil remain in his 
hands .) 
 Phorkyas (To Faust .) 
 
Hold tight to what alone remains to you.     9945 Don’t let the garment go. Already, daemons  
Pull at its hem, and wish to drag it down 
Into the Underworld. Hold tight to it, now! It no longer veils the divinity you’ve lost, 
But it is divine. Employ then the priceless,     9950 
Noble gift for yourself, and soar on high: It will carry you quickly from the lowest To the highest ether, while you can endure. 
We’ll meet once more, far away from here. 
 
(Helen’s garments dissolve in mist, surround Faust, life him into the air, and 
drift away with him .) 
 (Phorkyas takes Euphorion’s tunic, cl oak and lyre from the ground, steps 
forward to the proscenium, holds them aloft and speaks. ) 
 
As always, I’ve discovered something good!     9955 
The flame itself has gone, that’s understood, 
Yet, for the world, I can’t be truly sad. Here’s enough to fuel the poets’ regiment, Stir their guild to envy, make them mad, 
And if I still can’t lend them any talent,     9960 
At least I’ll have a costume for the lad.  
(She seats herself on a low column in the proscenium .) 
 
Panthalis 
 
Quick now, girls! We’re a ll free of the magic now, 
That old Thessalian woma n’s enthralling spell, 
That jangling dizziness of confusing sound, Troubling the ear, and more the inner sense.     9965 
Down to Hades! Since with  solemn step the Queen 
Descended swiftly. Let her faithful servants’ Footsteps follow her downwar d path without delay. 
We’ll find her beside the Unfathomable Throne.  
 
Chorus 
 
Of course, queens are happy anywhere:     9970 
Even in Hades they’re on top, 
Associating proudly with their peers, 
Persephone’s intimate company. But for us, then, in the background, 
Of the asphodel-meadowed depths,      9975 
With their long rows of poplars, Their fruitless crowds of willows, What fun is there for us, 
Piping like bats at twilight, 
In cheerless, ghostly whispers?       9980  
Panthalis 
 
Who wins no name, and wills no noble work, 
Belongs to the elements: so away with you! 
My own intense desire’s to be with my Queen, The individual’s loyalty and not just service. 
 
(Exits .) 
 
All 
 
We’re returned to the light of day,      9985 No longer individual, it’s true, 
We feel it, and we know it, 
But we’ll never go back to Hades. 
Ever-living Nature, Makes the most valid claim       9990 
On our spirits, and we on her.  
 
A Section of the Chorus 
 
We in all the thousand branches’ whispering tremors, swaying murmurs, 
Sweetly rocked, will lightly draw th e root-born founts of being upwards, 
To the twigs: and now with leaves, and now with the exuberant blossom, 
We’ll adorn their floating tresses, freely thriving in the breezes.  9995 
Straight away, now, as the fruit falls, happy crowds and flocks will gather, 
For the picking and the tasting, swift-arriving, busy-thronging: 
Bending down, now, all around us, as before the early gods. 
 
A Second Section of the Chorus  
 
We, against the rocky cliff face, by the smooth far-gleaming mirror,  
We will nestle, softly moving, in th e gentle waves that flatter:  10000 
Listening, hearing every echo, bi rdsong, now, or reedy fluting, 
To the fearful voice of Pan, too,  we’ll provide a ready answer: 
To the murmuring, send a murmur: to the thunder roll our thunder, 
In earth-shaking repetition, in threefold, or tenfold echo. 
 
A Third Section of the Chorus 
 
Sisters! We, of nimbler senses, hur ry onwards with the waters:  10005 
For the richly covered, far-off,  mountain ranges each entice us. 
Ever deeper, ever downward, in  meandering curves we’ll water 
First the meadows, then the pastur es, then the house and the garden, 
Where the slender tips of cypress,  over banks and watery mirror, 
Over all the landscape, mark it, so aring skywards in the air.  10010 
 
A Fourth Section of the Chorus 
 
Wander where you please, you others: we will circle, we will rustle 
Round the densely planted hillside, where the vine stock’s growing green: 
There, each day, we’ll pay atte ntion to the cultivator’s passion, Watch his diligence and care, there:  watch for its uncertain outcome. 
How he hoes, how he digs there, how he heaps, and prune s, and ties, 10015 
Prays to all the gods above him, mo st of all prays to the sun god. 
The effeminate one, Bacchus, gives s cant thought to faithful servants,  
Rests in arbours, lolls in caverns, flirting with the youngest Faun. 
Whatsoever he might need there,  for his half-befuddled dreaming, 
Is left for him in wineskins, stored  around in jars and vessels,   10020 
Right and left, in cool recesses, gathered through the endless ages. 
But when the gods, that’s Helios  we mean before all others, 
Cooling, wetting, warming, heating, fill the vineyard’s horn of plenty, 
Where the silent grower labour ed, suddenly it’s all enlivened, 
And in every leaf there’s rustling, rustling now from vine to vine. 10025 
Baskets creaking, buckets rattling, the tubs are carried groaning, 
All towards enormous vats there, to the lusty treaders’ dance: So, then, all the sacred bounty, of  the pure bred juicy harvest, 
Fiercely trodden, spurting, foaming, mi ngled there, is crudely squashed. 
Now the cymbals’ brazen clamour’s  ringing boldly in our ears,  10030 
As Dionysus from his Mysteries is unveiled, and is revealed: 
Here with his goat-foot Satyrs , whirling goat-foot Satyresses, 
And Silenus’s, unruly, long-eared ass, that brays amongst them. Nothing’s spared! The cloven fe et now, trample on all decency: 
All the senses whirl, bewildered: hi deously, ears are stunned, there. 10035 
Drunkards fumble for their wine-c ups, head and bellies over-full, 
Here and there one has misgivings, but can only swell the riot, Since to hold the latest vintage, one must drain the oldest skin! 
 
(The curtain falls. Phorkyas in the pr oscenium rises to full height, steps 
down from her tragic buskins, remo ves her mask and veil, and reveals 
herself as Mephistopheles, to point the last lines, by way of epilogue .) Part II Act IV Scene I: High Mountains 
 
(Fierce, jagged rocky peaks. A cloud approaches, pauses and settles on a 
projecting ledge. It parts .) 
 
Faust  (Steps out .) 
 Gazing at those deep so litudes beneath my feet, 
I tread the mountain brink with  deliberation,     10040 
Leaving the cloud-vehicle that carried me, 
Softly, through bright day, over land and ocean. Slowly, not dispersing, now, it moves away. 
With a rolling movement, travelling eastward, 
And the eye follows in wondering admiration.    10045 Moving it divides, wave-like and changeable. 
Yet it shapes itself – My eyes can’t deceive me! – 
I see, reclining there, nobly, on sunlit pillows,  A godlike female form, though it’s immense! 
An image of Juno, Leda, or Helen herself,     10050 
Royally lovely, floating before my eyes. Ah! It’s already melting! Formlessly huge 
And towering it hangs in far icy eastern hills, 
Reflecting deep meaning fr om fine fleeting days. 
Yet a soft, delicate band of mist still clings     10055 To head and body, coolly  caressing: and cheers me. 
Now it lifts lightly, soars higher and higher, there, 
Condensing. Does its en ticing shape deceive me, 
Like some long-forgotten joy of earliest youth? 
The first riches of the heart’s depths flow again:    10060 
I’d liken it to Aurora’s Love, light-winged: The first, swiftly felt, scarcely understood glance, 
That outshines every treas ure when it’s held fast. 
The lovely form rises, now, like spiritual beauty, Not melting further, but lifting through the air,    10065 
And carries, far-off, the best of what I am. 
 (A seven-league boot strides forward:  another follows immediately. 
Mephistopheles steps out of them. The boots stride off quickly .) 
 
Now that I call real onward striding! But tell me why you’re all alone, 
Climbing here among the horrors, 
In these horrendous gulfs of stone?      10070 
I know them well, but with another face, In truth, the floor of Hell’s a similar place. 
 
Faust 
 
You’re never short of a foolish fantasy: 
You’ve dusted that one off again I see. 
 Mephistopheles (Seriously ) 
 
When the Lord God – and I know why as well –    10075 Banished us from the ai r to deepest deeps, 
There, where round and round the glow of Hell, 
An eternal inward self-fuelled fire leaps, We found we were too brightly illuminated, 
Quite crowded, and uncomfortably situated.     10080 
All the devils fell to fits of coughing, The vents above them a nd beneath them puffing, 
Hell swollen with the sulphur’s stench and acid, 
Gave out its gas! The bubble was so massive, That soon the level surface of the earth,     10085 Thick as it was, was forced to crack and burst. 
So we all gained a nother mountain from it, 
And what was ground, be fore, now is summit. 
From this they deduced the truest law, 
Turn lowest into highest, to be sure,      10090 
Since we escaped from fiery prison there, To excessive power in the freer air: 
An open mystery, yet well concealed, 
And only lately publicly revealed. ( Ephesians vi:xii ) Faust 
 
To me the mountain masses are nobly dumb,     10095 
I don’t ask why they are, or where they’re from. 
When Nature in herself was grounded 
The ball of Earth she neatly rounded, 
Delighting in the mountains and the deep,  Setting rock on rock, and peak on peak,     10100 Sloping the hills conveniently downward, 
Softening them to vales, gently bounded. 
They grow green, and joyfully she ranges, Without the need for any violent changes.  
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Yes, so you say! It’s clear as day to you:     10105 
But he knows otherwise who saw it too. I was there, while th e void seethed below, 
Enduring all that swollen, fiery tide: 
When Moloch’s hammer forg ed cliffs, at a blow, 
And flung the ruined mountains, far and wide.    10110 
Those foreign boulders s cattered through the land: 
Who knows what forces left them high and dry? Philosophers all have failed to understand, 
The rocks are there, and we  must let them stand, 
We’ve damaged them, already,  where they lie.    10115 
Only the true believers, the people, know, And nothing will shake their fond opinion, 
They, since their wisdom ripened long ago, 
Say it’s due to Satan’s wonderful dominion. The traveller climbs, with faith’s  crutch, over ridges,    10120 
Across the Devil’s rocks, and Devil’s bridges. 
 
Faust 
 
Yet it’s still worth noting, since every feature, Reveals what it is the Devil sees in Nature. Mephistopheles 
 
What’s that to me! Let Nature be what she is! 
The Devil was there: that’s what I’d have you notice!   10125 
We’re the folk, you see, who achieve great things: 
The signs are tumult, force, and what nonsense brings! – 
But shall I make myself unde rstood at last: it’s best: 
Did nothing at all of ours please you in the slightest? You’ve looked down, from immeas urable heights,    10130 
On the riches of the world, and its splendid sights. ( Matthew iv ) 
Yet, hard as you may be to fire, Didn’t you feel some deep desire? 
 
Faust 
 
I did! I saw a mighty plan. 
Guess!  
Mephistopheles 
 
                 Oh, that’s easily done.      10135 
I’d find myself some capital city, 
It’s core the citizens’ greedy plenty, Crooked alleys and pointed gables, Cabbage, turnips, onions, market tables: 
Butcher’s stalls where flies all cluster:      10140 
Round the fattened join ts, pass muster: 
Wherever you move, there you’ll find 
Stench and activity, intertwined. 
Then wide streets, and wider squares,  Measured, elegant thoroughfares:      10145 
And, at their end, no gates to bar you: 
Just boundless far-flung suburbs too. There I love to see all the carriages go by, 
The noisy rushing about from side to side, 
The endless running to and fro,       10150 Of scattered ants in ceaseless flow. And when I walk, and when I ride, 
I’d be the central point implied, 
A hundred thousand honouring me.  
Faust 
 
That could never content me though.      10155 
A swelling crowd is fine to see, 
All well-fed in their way, agreed, 
Well-bred, well-taught, all the three – Yet you’ve only made more rebels grow.  
Mephistopheles 
 
For myself, I’d deliberately create      10160 
A pleasure house in a pleasant place. 
Woods, hills, fields, meadows, open ground, With splendid gardens all around. 
Between green walls of velvet leaves, 
Straight walks, where artful shadows please,     10165 Waterfalls, spanning the rocks, in pairs, 
And all those kinds of water-jet affairs: 
Rising nobly, while all round the dish, A thousand little fountains hiss and piss. 
Then I’d have a hut, snug a nd convenient,     10170 
Where beautiful wome n might be content: 
And pass the boundless time away In the sweetest solitude, and play. 
Women, I say: since, one and all, 
I think of their loveliness in the plural.      10175  
Faust 
 
Sardanapalus! Modern and rural! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Then might one ask to know your yearning? 
It’s something daring: I’ve no doubt.  Since the moon was near you in your journeying, Might it be moon-madness you ’re about?     10180 Faust 
 
Not at all! This earthly round 
Grants space for some mighty thing. We’ll attempt what’s astonishing, 
New strength for daring work I’ve found. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
And shall you earn more glory by it too?     10185 
One sees the heroines have been with you.  
Faust 
 
I’ll win power, and property! 
The deed is all, and not the glory. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Yet future poets’ verse will stress 
The splendour of your bright success,      10190 
And inspire fools to foolishness. 
 
Faust  
All that’s far from you, indeed. 
What do you know of what Men need? Your contrary being, bitter, dire, 
What does it know of Man’s desire?      10195 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Let it all be as you wish it then! 
Trust fancy’s flight to me again. 
 
Faust 
 
My eyes were drawn to wards the deepest ocean: 
It swelled, and heaped itself, upon itself, 
Then ebbed, and shook its wave s again in motion,    10200 Storming towards the wide shore’s level shelf. 
And that annoyed me: as the exuberance 
Of a free spirit, that values all its rights, 
Will transmit uneasy feelings to the dance Of the passionate blood that it excites.      10205 
I thought it chance: I gazed more intensely: 
The waves paused, rolled away from me, Far from what they’d r eached in their pride: 
Time passes, and then on ce more comes the tide. 
 
Mephistopheles (To the audience .) 
 
There’s nothing new in that to greet my ears,     10210 
I’ve known it for a hundred thousand years.  
Faust (Continuing passionately .) 
 It sweeps along, to whatever thousand ends: 
Fruitless itself, it fruitlessly extends: 
It swells and rolls and breaks and overwhelms The empty stretches of its barren realms.     10215 
There wave rules powe r-inspired wave, again 
Draws back – and yet still there’s nothing gained. If anything makes me de spair, of my intent, 
It’s the aimless force of  that wild element! 
Then my spirit dared to soar high above:     10220 
Here I must fight, and this I must remove. And it’s possible! – However tides may flow, 
At last they nestle round the hills below: 
So they are tamed in their exuberance, A modest height tops their proud advance,     10225 
A modest depth draws them forcefully on. 
Quick, through my mind, leapt plan after plan: Let rich enjoyment be mine for evermore, 
To keep the noble oc ean from the shore, 
To channel all the wide and watery waste,     10230 
And urge it backwards to its own deep place. Step by step I know how to design it: 
That’s my desire, so be brave and promote it! 
 (On the right, from the distance, behind the audience, the sound of drums 
and military music .) 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
That’s trivial! Can you hear the distant drums? 
 
Faust 
 
War again! The wise man hate s it when it comes.    10235 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
War or peace, it’s wise  to seize the chance, 
And gain advantage from the circumstance. 
One waits, one notes each favourable moment. 
Opportunity’s about, so Faust, be ardent!  
Faust 
 
Spare me all your riddles, if you please!     10240 
Once and for all, say, what am I to seize?  
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Nothing was hidden from me on my journey: 
The noble Emperor’s consumed by worry. You know him. While we both supplied him, 
Those illusory riches in his hand, beside him,    10245 
The whole world then was open to him. Young, the throne was granted to him, 
And it pleased him to assume, wrongly, 
That he could easily combine the two, Enjoy the essential and the lovely too:      10250 
Both government and pleasure, jointly. 
 
Faust 
 
A fatal error! He who wishes to command 
Must make command his joy, and though His mind is full of all the noblest plans, 
What he intends, must let no other know.     10255 
What he whispers then in some faithful ear, 
Is done, and the world will be amazed to hear. So he’ll remain suprem e, above them all, 
And noblest: pleasure comes before a fall. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
That’s not the man! He enjoye d himself, and how!    10260 
Meanwhile anarchy brou ght the empire down, 
While great fought little, and orders crossed, 
And brothers fought with brothers, and were lost, 
Castle with castle, city against city, The guilds at war with the nobility:      10265 
The bishops with their congregation: 
No friends, and only a hostile nation. In churches death and slaughter: through the gate 
Every merchant and trad er swift to his fate. 
Now, everywhere, man’s audacity shows:     10270 The word is ‘defend your life’. And so it goes. 
 
Faust 
 
So it goes – it stumbles, falls, and stands again, 
Then tumbles headlong, and lies there in pain. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
None dared to criticise the situation, Each could, and would improve his station.     10275 
Even the smallest wished to be great enough. 
But for the best it proved a step too much. The capable declared, with energy: 
‘He who brings peace can have the mastery. 
The Emperor can’t, and will not – let us choose    10280 A new Emperor, who’ll in spire the realm anew. 
While each man achieves security, 
In a world that’s re-created freshly, 
Let peace and justice th ere be wedded, too.’  
Faust 
 
That smacks of priesthood.       10285 
 
Mephistopheles 
     The priests were there, yes, 
Defending their well-fed stomachs with the rest, And they were more involved than all the others. 
The rebels swarmed: and we re blessed as brothers: 
Then the Emperor, whom  we had made happy, 
Advanced, for his last battle, that’s as maybe.     10290 
 
Faust 
 
I’m sorry for him: He was so frank and open. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
We’ll watch! While there’s life there’s hope again. 
Let’s set him free, from this narrow valley! 
He’s a thousand times save d, if they would rally. 
Who knows how the dice might fall, if so:     10295 Good luck, and he’ll have treasures to bestow.  
(They cross over the middle range of hills, and view th e army in the valley. 
Drums and military music sound from below .) 
 
The position they’ve taken, there, looks fine: 
We’ll join them: victory – in the nick of time.  
Faust 
 
And what should I expect to see? 
A hollow show! Blind magic! Trickery!     10300   
Mephistopheles 
 
Strategy, and how to win a battle! 
Think hard, and be on your mettle, 
Keep dreaming of your mighty aim. 
If we return the Emperor his land, You can kneel, and make a claim,      10305 In payment, for the boundless strand. 
 
Faust 
 
You’ve managed all the other things, 
So win the battle, and what it brings!  
Mephistopheles 
 
No, you’ll win it! There, beneath, 
You’ll be their commander-in-chief.      10310 
 
Faust 
 
That’s a somewhat glorified position: 
Knowing nothing, to command the mission!   
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Leave it to the General Staff to care, 
And see a Field-Marshall newborn there. 
I know all about Un-Councils of War      10315 Form your War Council, quickly, therefore, 
From ancient hills’ ancient human power: 
Bless those who can pile  peaks in a tower. 
 
Faust 
 
What do I see, what warriors approach? 
Have you truly roused the mountain folk?     10320  Mephistopheles 
 
No! But like Shakespeare’s Peter Quince, 
I’ve picked the very best of what there is.  
(The Three Mighty Warriors appear .) 
 Here are my lads arriving now! You see they’re all of different ages, 
And clothes and armour too: allow      10325 
That you’ll be fine when battle rages.  
(To the audience .) 
 Every child today loves to see 
Knights in armour take the floor: 
Allegorical thoug h they may be, 
They’ll delight them all the more.      10330 
 
Bullyboy (Young, lightly armed, plainly clothed .) 
 
If someone meets me face to face, 
I’ll shake a fist right there in his ugly mug, And when the yellow-belly runs away, I’ll grasp his hair, and give a nasty tug. 
 
Grab-quick (Mature, well-armed, richly dressed .) 
 
Such idle brawling’s foolishness,      10335 
That’s how to ruin the day: Don’t be slow first to possess, 
Then afterwards you’ll get your way. 
 Hold-tight (Older, heavily arme d, without a cloak .) 
 
But that’s the path where little’s won! Great possession’s quickly gone,      10340 Vanishing in the stream of life. 
It’s fine to take, but best to hold: 
Let grey hairs command the bold, And you’ll lose nothing in the strife.  
Part II Act IV Scene II: On the Headland 
 
(Drums and military music from below.  The Emperor’s tent is pitched .) 
 
 (The Emperor, Commander-in-Chief, Guardsmen .) 
 
The Commander-in-Chief  
It still seems the most likely strategy,      10345 
To have made our whole army wait, Here below, in this convenient valley: 
I hope the choice is truly fortunate. 
 
The Emperor 
 
Whatever will happen now, we’ll soon see: 
But I don’t like this half-retreat, it’s weak.     10350 
 
The Commander-in-Chief 
 
Look here, my Prince, on our right flank! 
This terrain is one that Generals like to thank: The hills aren’t steep, but there’s no ready access, So it protects us, while denying them success: 
We’re half-concealed, on undul ating ground:    10355 
Their cavalry won’t da re to circle round. 
 
The Emperor 
 
There’s nothing left for me to do, but praise: 
Here strength and braver y may have their day. 
 
The Commander-in-Chief 
 
There, in the centre  of the level space, 
See the phalanx, eagerly in place.      10360 The lances shine and glitter in the air, 
Through the sunlit mist of morning, there. 
And all the mighty square is swaying darkly! Thousands inspired to fierce activity. 
There you can see our power en masse ,     10365 
I trust it to split the enemy in half. 
 
The Emperor 
 
This is the first time I’ve ever gazed on such a sight. 
Forces like these are worth double when they fight.  
The Commander-in-Chief 
 
I’ve nothing to report about our left, 
Valiant heroes hold the rocky cleft,      10370 
Weapons gleam across the rocky dale, A vital pass protects the narrow vale. 
Here the enemy power, I think, will shatter, 
Taken unawares in this bloody matter.  
The Emperor 
 
There they advance, my faith less kith and kin,    10375 
Even as they call me br other, uncle, cousin, 
Ever more widely, a llowing men’s respect 
For throne and sceptre to fall into neglect:  Ruining the empire with their fighting, 
And now, against me, rebelliously uniting.     10380 
The mob is swayed, un certain in its mind, 
Then, wherever the stream flows, flows behind. 
 
The Commander-in-Chief 
 
A faithful soldier hastens towards us, look, 
One sent for news, perhaps he’s had some luck!  
First Scout 
 
Luckily we met success,        10385 Brave and cunning in our skill, 
Probing, out to east and west, 
Yet bring you bad news, still. Many swear their loyalty,  
Many a faithful company:       10390 
Yet all idly apologetic: 
Quailing inwardly, apathetic.  
The Emperor 
 
From selfishness they learn self-preservation, 
Not honour, affection, gratitude, dedication. 
No one thinks that when time brings the reckoning,    10395 
The neighbour’s house ignites theirs while it’s burning.  
The Commander-in-Chief 
 
The second scout’s approaching, slowly, 
On stumbling legs: a man full weary. 
 
Second Scout 
 
At first we easily detected 
The nature of their wild plan:       10400 
Then, suddenly, and unexpected, 
A second Emperor was at hand. And in a calm, and orderly manner Withdrew the army from the deep: 
Unfurling his deceitful banner:       10405 
They all followed him, like sheep!  
The Emperor 
 
A second Emperor’s fortunate for me: 
Since I’m the Emperor, plain as plain can be. 
Now as a soldier I’ll dress myself, again, In armour, dedicated to this higher aim.     10410 
My entertainments, fine as they all were, 
Lacking in nothing, never brought me danger.  While you suggested something innocent, My heart longed to fight the tournament: 
And had you not dissuaded me  from war,     10415 
I’d have shone in glorious deeds before. But when I was mirrored in  that realm of fire, 
I felt my heart was mi ne, and made entire: 
The fierce element entered in my fate, 
Only a dream, and yet the dream was great.     10420 I’ve thought confusedly of fame and glory: 
Yet all was my own neglect, an evil story. 
 (The heralds are sent to challenge the rival Emperor to single combat .) 
 
(Faust enters, in armour, with half-clos ed visor. The Three Mighty Warriors 
appear armed and dressed as  previously described .) 
 
Faust 
 
We’re here, and hope our presence is accepted: 
Though needless, caution’ s often well respected. 
You know how hill-folk consider and explore:    10425 They study nature and the mountains’ lore. 
The spirits drawn from out the level valley, 
Are happier than ever in  the wide hill-country. 
They still work the labyrinthine masses, 
Among metallic fumes of nobl e gases.      10430 
Intent on separating,  proving, blending, 
Their only aim some innovative finding. With gentle touch and spiritual power, 
They build transparent forms, by the hour: 
Then in eternal silence, in  the crystal,      10435 
They watch the destiny of all things mortal. 
 
The Emperor 
 
I’ve heard it said: and I believe it’s true: 
But, gallant soldier, what’s all that to you?  
Faust 
 
Your true and honourable servant there, 
Is that Sabine, the Norcian Necromancer.     10440 
What fearful fate once hung above his head! 
Crackling wood, the stinging fire ahead: Dry timber packed already round his feet, 
With rolls of pitch and brimstone all complete: 
No warrior, god, or devil to the rescue,     10445 
The Emperor saved his life: and that was you, In Rome: he was oblig ed, and none the less 
Anxiously, he contemplates your progress. 
Wholly forgotten: every hour, just for you, He studies the stars and the abyss too.      10450 He sent us on, by the swiftest path, 
To help you. Great is the mountain craft: 
There Nature works omnipotent, and free, Though foolish clerics call it wizardry. 
 
The Emperor 
 
On joyful days, when we greet our guests,     10455 
Who gather pleasantly, with happy jests, It gives us pleasure, when they pull and push, 
And fill the halls and chambers with their crush. 
Yet the brave man meets with noblest welcome, When in fierce support he deigns to come,     10460 
At the dawning of some perilous day, 
When fate’s balance holds us in its sway. Yet while some time th is moment can afford, 
Hold back your strong ha nd from the eager sword, 
Honour the instant, when t housands march,     10465 
For or against me, taking up the torch. Self’s the Man! Who claims the crown and throne, 
Must be worthy of the honour, on his own. 
May the phantom now that stands against me, Who calls himself the Empero r of my country,    10470 
The army’s leader, and th e lords’ crowned head, 
Be hurled by my own fist among the dead.  
Faust 
 
Whatever the need to fini sh what you’ve started, 
It would go ill if you and your head were parted. 
Isn’t your helmet decked with  plume and crest?    10475 
It shields the head that f ills our hearts with zest. Without a head what can the members do? 
If it should sleep, they sink in silence too: 
If it’s injured, they’re all hurt alike, 
And if it’s healed they quickly stir to life.     10480 Swiftly the arm will assert its right: 
And shield the head then from the fight: 
The sword at once perceives its duty, Strikes again, and parries strongly: The brave foot, owning its luck again,      10485 
Plants itself on the necks of the slain. 
 
The Emperor 
 
Such is my wrath, that’s how I’d use the fool, 
And set his head in front of me, for a stool. 
 
Heralds  (Returning .) 
 
Our advances they reject, 
With little honour, or respect.       10490 Our strong, and noble ultimatum, 
They treated as an empty statement: 
‘Your Emperor is wholly lost, An echo of some ancient rhyme: When we think about the past,       10495 
His tale will be: Once upon a time.’ 
 
Faust 
 
It’s come to pass as the best of men demand, 
Those firm and true, at your right hand: 
There is the foe: your men stand by us: 
Order the advance, the time’s propitious.     10500 
 
The Emperor 
 
I hereby relinquish the command. 
 
(To the Commander-In-Chief ) 
 Prince, I entrust the duty to your hand. 
 
The Commander-in-Chief 
 
Then let the right wing start its assault! 
The enemy left’s ascending, even now, 
And in a moment will be fo rced to halt.     10505 
To our young faithfuls they will have to bow.      
Faust 
 
Let this brave hero, straight away, 
Join your ranks, without delay, 
So that in your ranks he might, Make a brave show in the fight.       10510 
 
(He points to the Mighty Warrior on the right .) 
 
Bully-Boy (Coming forward .) 
 He who shows his face to me, won’t turn 
Before his front and back teeth shatter: 
He who shows his back to me will earn A blow to make his head much flatter. And if your soldiers then advance      10515 
With sword and mace, together, 
Man after man, the foe will dance, And in their own blood quickly smother. 
 
(He exits .) 
 
The Commander-in-Chief 
 
Let the central phalanx follow slowly, 
Engage the enemy with force and cunning:     10520 
There on the right they’re almost ready To surrender, you can see them running.  Faust (Pointing to the central Warrior ) 
 
Let this man follow at your command! 
He’s quick, and grabs with either hand. 
 
Grab-quick (Comes forward .) 
 The thirst for plunder now will greet      10525 The Emperor’s troops’ advancing feet, 
And all will gather, with intent, 
At the rival Emperor’s tent. He won’t linger on his throne: 
I’ll lead the phalanx on my own.      10530 
 Swift-plunder (A camp follower, fawning on him .) 
 
Although he and I aren’t wed, He’s my sweetheart. Here instead 
Autumn ripens for the bold! 
Woman’s fierce when she takes hold, Merciless, in a plundering crowd,      10535 
Forward to victory! All’s allowed. 
 (They exit together .) 
 
The Commander-in-Chief 
 
As I anticipated on our left flank, 
They hurl their right, in force, at last. 
We’ll resist their furious ranks, And keep them from the narrow pass.      10540 
 
Faust (Beckoning to the Warrior on the left .) 
 
Prince, take note of this man too: 
No shame if the strong are stronger than you.  Hold-tight (Coming forward .) 
 
Let the flanks forget their fear! I seize the ground where I appear: 
In me are born the powers of old,      10545 
No lightning splits what I shall hold. 
 Mephistopheles  (Descending from above .) 
 
Now see how from the hinterland Of this rocky jagged land, An armed host bursts forth 
On narrow pathways from the north,      10550 
With sword and helmet, shield and spear, Forming a rampart in our rear: 
They wait for the signal to charge on. 
 (Aside, to the knowing ones .) 
 
You mustn’t ask me where they’re from. I’ve gathered them from everywhere,      10555 
The armouries all around are bare: 
They stood on foot, and sat astride, Like lords of earth on every side: 
They were emperors, knights, and kings, 
Now they’re the empty shells of things:     10560 I’ve dressed so many spirits for the strife, It’s like the Middle Ages come to life. 
Whichever little devils are inside, 
They’ll have enough effect to turn the tide.  
(Aloud .) 
 Listen how they show their anger,      10565 
Jostling, in metallic clangour! 
The ragged banners flutter free, That waited restless for the breeze. 
Think: here’s an ancient race that’s ready 
To mingle in our new dispute, and gladly.      10570  (A tremendous peal of trumpets from above: a perceptible tremor in the 
hostile army .) 
 Faust 
 
The far horizon darkens swiftly, 
Yet, here and there, and meaningfully, There’s an incipient crimson glow, 
Already the battlefield gleams there, 
The rocks, the woods, the atmosphere,      10575 The very heavens join the show.  
Mephistopheles 
 
The right flank holds in strength: 
There’s Bullyboy the nimble giant, 
Towering over all, defiant, And charging them at length.       10580 
 
The Emperor 
 
First I saw an arm uplifted, 
Then at least a dozen shifted: The thing’s unnatural. 
 
Faust 
 
Don’t you know the bands of mist 
That drift round the Sicilian cliffs?      10585 
There, in the daylight, clear, In mid-air, hovering about 
Mirrored in peculiar cloud, 
Marvellous images appear.  
Cities wander to and fro,        10590 
Gardens rise above, below, 
As form on form fills the air.  
The Emperor 
 
Yet it’s suspicious! All about 
The tips of spears are shining out: 
On our phalanx’ gleaming lances,      10595 
I see a crowd of flame-lets dances. It looks quite ghostly there, to me. 
 
Faust 
 
Forgive me, Lord, t hose are the traces 
Of natural spirits, vanished races, 
A glimmer of the Dioscuri,       10600  
Sailors invoke in tempest’s fury: They show their last strength there. 
 
The Emperor  
But tell me: who then might command 
Nature’s assistance for our land, This gathering of the rare?       10605 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Who else than that noble Master,  
Who takes your destiny to heart? The thought of military disaster  
Moves him deeply, stirs his art. 
In gratitude, he wants to save you,      10610 Though he himself should suffer too.  
The Emperor 
 
They cheered me, when I was invested: 
So I was keen to se e my power tested: 
I found it useful, without much thought, as ruler, To send that wise man where the air was cooler.    10615 
I robbed the clergy of a fond desire, 
And hardly won their favour from the fire. Now that so many years have gone 
Is this the reward of what I’d done?  
Faust 
 
Good deeds from the heart reap riches:     10620 
Let your glance stray upwards now! 
I think he’ll send a sign, a show, 
Attend: straight away it’s as he wishes.  
The Emperor   
  
An eagle soars in the upper air, A Gryphon attacks him there.       10625 
 
Faust 
 
Attend: It’s an auspicious feature. 
The Gryphon’s a fabulous creature: How could he forget who’s regal,  
And tangle with a real eagle? 
 
The Emperor 
 
And now, they fly in wider gyres,      10630 
They wheel together: swiftly now Then dash against each other’s bow, 
So neck and chest are ripped entire. 
 
Faust 
 
Now note the miserable Gryphon, 
Ripped and rumpled, hurt quite badly,      10635 
Now, with his lion’s tail all torn, 
He falls, and vanishes in a tree.   
The Emperor 
 
As it’s prophesied, so let it be! 
This whole thing’s astounding me. 
 Mephistopheles (Towards the right .) 
 
Driven by blows, ten times repeated,      10640 
The enemy force has retreated, And in the uncertain fight 
Drifts away towards the right, 
So defusing all the force Of their army’s sinister course.       10645 Our phalanx with its spears tightening 
Moves to the right, and like lightening 
Strikes them in the weakest place: Now like the storm-driven waves 
They roar, with opposing force,       10650 
Wildly on their dual course: Gloriously all sound dies away, 
And victory is ours, I’d say! 
 
The Emperor (On the left, to Faust .) 
 
See! Something looks suspicious, Our position’s inauspicious,       10655 
Not a stone’s hurled in the air, 
The cliffs below are taken there, Bare the narrows, to the pass. Now! The enemy en masse  
Are ever nearer to th e sun,       10660 
Perhaps we’re already overrun: An end to this unholy strife! 
Your arts won’t save my life.  
 (Pause .) 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
See, my two ravens come winging, 
What news might they be bringing?      10665 I fear we’re in trouble here. The Emperor 
 
What do they mean th ese wretched birds? 
Their black wings turn hitherwards, Out of the heat of battle they steer. 
 
Mephistopheles (To the ravens .) 
 Both of you sit by my ear,       10670 
None are lost if you are near, 
Your council’s always good to hear.  
Faust  (To the Emperor .) 
 You’ll know about homing pigeons 
Ones that return from distant regions, 
To their nest, and food, and young.      10675 Here’s a slightly different kind: 
Pigeon post in peace is fine, 
Raven posts to war belong.   
Mephistopheles 
 
The birds announce a dreadful fate: 
Beware the enemy at the gate,       10680 
Near our heroes’ rocky wall! 
They’ve attained the narrow height, If they gain the pass, and fight, 
Our position’s critical.  
 
The Emperor 
 
So I’m betrayed at last!        10685 
Into your net I’ll be cast: 
I shudder as it entangles me. Mephistopheles 
 
Courage, now! Not yet, their victory. 
Patience and skill unties the knot! It’s often fiercest at the end.       10690 
The pair of messengers, we’ve got: 
Command me, I’ll command them!  The Commander-In-Chief  (Who has arrived, meanwhile .) 
 
You’ve united with this pair, Tormenting me while I was there, 
No luck comes from wizardry.       10695 
I can’t fathom now how to win  Those should finish, that begin:  
Take this baton away from me. 
 
The Emperor 
 
Keep it for another day, one better 
And blessed with better fortune.      10700 
I shudder at this messenger, 
And his company of ravens.  (To Mephistopheles .) 
 
I’ll not grant the baton to you, You’re not the proper man: 
Give commands: free us too!       10705 
Do whatever it is you can.  
(He exits into his tent with the Commander-In-Chief .) 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Let that blunt stick protect the man! 
It’s of small use in anyone’s hand: It has a cross, too, painted on. Faust 
 
What can we do? 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
           It’s already done!     10710 
Now dark Cousins, hu rry from the scene, 
To the mountain lake! Greet the Undines, 
And beg from them their gleaming flood. 
Their female arts, those difficult of knowing, Can divorce appearances from being,      10715 
And all still swear it’s being that they’re seeing. 
 (Pause ) 
 
Faust 
 
With flattery our pair of ravens 
Have so charmed those water maidens That trickling flows at once begin. 
And many a bald, dry ridge of mountain     10720 
Becomes a swollen, rushing fountain: The enemy can no longer win.  
Mephistopheles 
 
It’s not a greeting to which they’re used. 
The bravest climbers appear confused. 
 
Faust 
 
Now, powerfully, streams pour on streams,     10725 
Sweeping from gorges with redoubled gleams, 
A river now throws up an arching veil: 
Pours over the rocky level in a tide, Runs foaming down, on every side, And, stepwise, hurls itself into the dale.     10730 
What use their fine, heroic resistance? 
The vast wave roars, and fills the distance. I shudder myself at this wild waterfall.  
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I can see nothing of these watery lies, 
They only serve for fooling human eyes,     10735 
I delight instead in wonders that befall. In companies, their men plunge down,  The fools imagine that they’ll drown, 
While free to breathe, on solid ground, 
With swimming strokes, they run around.     10740 It’s bewildering them all. 
 
(The Ravens return .) 
 
I’ll praise you to the noble Master: but see, 
If you’d like to display your own mastery, Hurry to the glowing smithy, 
Where the dwarf folk never weary,      10745 
Hammering sparks from steel and stone. Ask for, once you’ve chattered first, 
A fire to shine: sparkle, and burst, 
The finest that man’s ever known. It’s true that far off lightning flashes,      10750 And stars that fall in sudden dashes, 
Can happen any summer’s night: 
But lightning in the tangled bushes, And stars that fizzle in the rushes, 
They’re not such a common sight.      10755 
Don’t trouble about my command, Ask first, then afterwards demand. 
 
(The Ravens fly off. All takes place as ordered .) 
 
Darkness cloaks the enemy! 
Their footsteps meet uncertainty! Everywhere are wandering flares,       10760 And those sudden blinding glares! 
It’s all beautiful indeed, 
Now some noise is what we need.  
Faust 
 
The empty armour from each vaulted room, 
Feels itself stiffen in the airy gloom:      10765 
There it rattles, clatters all around, 
A marvellous, and deceptive sound.  
Mephistopheles 
 
That’s it! They no longer feel constrained: 
Already their blows  fall unrestrained, 
As in the nobility of their former life.      10770 
Breastplates and helmets gleam, As Guelph and Ghibelline, 
They quickly renew eternal strife. 
Locked in hereditary bile, They prove themselves, un-reconciled:     10775 
Far and wide the noise is rife. 
In the end, by all the Devils, yes! Partisan hatred’s still the best, 
Till final ruin ends the tale: 
Here rise the sounds of utter panic,      10780 And others bitter and Satanic, Terrify, along the vale. 
 
(Warlike tumult from the orchestra, fi nally changing to a lively martial air .) Part II Act IV Scene III: The Rival Emperor’s Tent 
 
(A throne amongst rich trappings. Grab-quick and Swift-plunder .) 
 
Swift-plunder 
 
We’re the first ones here, I see!  
Grab-quick 
 
No Raven flies as fast as me. 
 
Swift-plunder 
 
O! Look at the treasure there on top!      10785 
What will I grab? How shall I stop? 
 
Grab-quick 
 
The whole place is still full of loot, 
I don’t know where to start, in truth! 
 
Swift-plunder 
 
This fur-rug, this’ll go far, 
Often my bed’s far too hard.        10790 
 
Grab-quick 
 
Here’s a morning star in steel, 
I’ve always longed for one, I feel.   
 
Swift-plunder 
 
This red mantle, trimmed with gold, 
Is like the one my dream foretold. Grab-quick (Taking a weapon .) 
 
With this the deed is swiftly done,      10795 
You strike him dead and then move on. You’ve already packed so  much stuff, 
And yet you’ve nothing good enough. 
Leave your plunder in its place, And put a casket in the space!       10800 The army’s pay is what they hold, 
In their fat bellies, purest gold. 
 
Swift-plunder 
 
What a murderous weight it is! 
I can’t lift: I can’t carry it. 
 
Grab-quick 
 
Bend down: quick! You’ll have to bow!     10805 
I’ll strap it to your back for now.  
Swift-plunder 
 
Oh! Ah! Now it’s in front, too! 
The weight’s broken my cross in two. 
 
(The chest falls and bursts open .) 
 
Grab-quick 
 
There’s the red gold in a heap – 
Quickly now, take and keep!       10810 
 Swift-plunder (Crouching .) 
 
Quickly then, just fill my lap! There’ll still be enough perhaps. Grab-quick 
 
That’s enough! Now off you go! 
 
(Swift-plunder rises .) 
 
Oh! Your apron has a hole! Wherever you walk or stand,       10815 You’re sowing gold on every hand. 
 
Guardsmen of the True Emperor 
 
What are you doing here, at leisure,  
Rummaging in the Imperial treasure?  
Grab-quick 
 
We risked our bodies in the ranks, 
And take away our share of thanks.      10820 
That’s the rule, in enemy tents, And we’re soldiers too, my friends.  
 
The Guardsmen 
 
That won’t wash in our army: 
You can’t be soldie r and thief equally: 
Whoever serves our Emperor,       10825 Is an honest soldier, and no more. 
 
Grab-quick  
That honesty, we know it, son, 
It’s called: a contribution. You’re all the same: it’s a crime, 
‘Give!’ is the password every time,      10830 
 (To Swift-plunder .) 
 
Take what you’ve got: and leave the rest, 
Here one’s hardly a welcome guest.  
(They both exit .) 
 
A Guardsman 
 
Tell me why you didn’t land 
That churl with a good right hand.  
A Second Guardsman 
 
I don’t know, my strength was gone,      10835 
They were a pair of ghostly ones.  
 
A Third Guardsman 
 
There was something nasty in my eye, 
I couldn’t see: they flickered by.  
A Fourth Guardsman 
 
I don’t know what to say: 
It was sweltering hot today,       10840 
So sultry, so close as well, One man stood, another fell: You staggered around and struck, in one, 
At every blow you killed someone, 
There was a mist in front of your eyes,     10845 Then a buzz, and rustle, and hiss went by: 
So it went on, and here we are, now, 
I don’t know what happened, anyhow.  
(The Emperor enters, accompanied by  Four Princes. The Guardsmen exit .) 
 Now, let him do as he may!  The battle here is done, 
The host is scattered in flight, across the field new won.   10850 
Here is the traitor’s treasure, and his empty throne, Where tapestries hang round, closed in a narrow zone. Protected by our guard of honour, we’ll wait 
Imperially, for the people’s delegate. 
Messengers of joy arrive fro m every side:     10855 The Empire’s calm, and we ’re mutually reconciled. 
Though some wizardry was involved in our fight, 
In the end we fought with only our own true might. 
There were of course a few lucky accidents: Stones from the sky, a shower of blood on their tents,   10860 
Strange and mighty sounds from the rocky caves, 
That lifted our hearts, and terrified their braves. The conquered fell, beneat h our relentless scorn, 
Praising the kind god, our ranks cheer once more. 
And all, without coercion, shou t together as one:    10865 
‘God be praised!’ from a million throats is wrung. Yet in highest praise I turn my own pious glance 
As I seldom do, towards my own circumstance. 
A young man may well squa nder his early days, 
But age teaches him all the e rror of his ways.    10870 
Therefore at once without delay I bind you to me, 
You noble four, to my House, Court and country.  
(To the First .) 
 Prince, yours was the army’s ordering, wisely planned, 
Then, at the height of the battle, its bold command: 
Now act, in time of peace, as the hour requires you to,   10875 I name you High-Marshall, and confer the sword on you.  
The High-Marshall 
 
Your loyal army, deployed, on my orders, 
Internally, will now defend your borders, 
Let us, too, prepare the table on feast days,  In your spacious castle’s an cestral ways.     10880 
Always to be your Hi gh Majesty’s defence, 
Standing beside you, or marching in advance.   
The Emperor  (To the Second .) 
 You, who show yourself as gracious as you’re brave, 
Be our High-Chamberlain:  the office is grave. 
You become the overseer of all our attendants,    10885 
Great evil comes from strife among dependants: So let your example honourably recall 
How they may please their prince, the court and all. 
 
The High-Chamberlain 
 
Be gracious, that the Lords ma y further your great aim: 
Assist the best and cause no injury to the lame,    10890 Be open without cunning: be calm without deceit! If you know me, Sire, my ambition is complete. 
But on the feast may I now deploy my imagination? 
When you’re at table, I shall bear the golden basin, I’ll hold your rings, that on those joyful days     10895 
Your hands may be refreshed, as I am by your gaze. 
 
The Emperor 
 
I feel too serious for ready celebration, 
But, be it so, as a joyful inauguration! 
  
(To the Third .) 
 
I make you High-Steward!  Oversee the chase, 
The poultry yard, and such, around the place:    10900 Give me the finest dishes, choice and rare, In their right month, and carefully prepared. 
 
The High-Steward 
 
Strict fast will be my pleasant punishment, 
Till I can serve the tastiest refreshment. Your kitchen staff will join with me to bring     10905 
The distant near, and make  the year take wing. 
Yet early and rare won’t stimulate your fires, Simple and strong, is wh at your taste desires. 
 
The Emperor  (To the Fourth .) 
 Since planning feasts is unavoidable here, 
Young hero, I’ll give you my cup to bear.     10910 
High-Cupbearer, take care those cellars of mine Are richly filled with casks of vintage wine. 
Be temperate yourself: don’t lose your reason 
In the wild delight of momentary temptation! 
 
The High-Cupbearer 
 
The young, if you trust in them, my Prince,     10915 
Grow to manhood, almost before you’d notice. I’ll take my place too at your noble feast: 
And load the imperial table with all that’s best, 
With every kind of vessel, in silver and gold, But the handsomest of all for you I’ll hold:     10920 
A clear Venetian glass, where joy is waiting, 
That strengthens the taste, without intoxicating. One often trusts too much in such a treasure: 
But your restraint, Lord, will protect your pleasure. 
 
The Emperor 
 
What I bestow on you at this grave moment,     10925 
You hear, in confidence, has my true intent. 
The Emperor’s word is great, his gift is sure, 
But to be enacted it needs his signature, His noble mark. Here’s the right man I see True to his time, to complete the formality.     10930 
 
(The Archbishop and High-Chancellor enters .) 
 
If the arch can trust the keystone’s part, 
Then it’s raised securely, with lasting art. You see four Princes here! And I’ve explained 
How my House and Court must be sustained. 
Now, what the empire holds within its bounds    10935 Is placed, with weight and power, in your hands. 
You’ll outshine all others in your estates: 
So I’ve extended your walls and gates, With the lost possessions of our enemy. I award you fine lands, for your loyalty.     10940 
Together with the right, in due course, 
To buy, exchange, or add to them by force: Then, be it known, I grant you unhindered use – 
Of what belongs to you, the landlord’s dues. 
When you as judges speak your  final thought,    10945 
No appeal shall be heard by a higher court. Then taxes, levies, rents, and tolls and fees, 
Are yours: of mines, mints, salt the royalties. 
And to display my gratitude completely, I’ve raised you all to highest majesty.      10950 
 
The Archbishop 
 
On behalf of us all I give our deepest thanks to you! 
You make us strong and sure: increasing your power too. 
 
The Emperor 
 
To you five, still higher favours will I give. I live for my empire, and I still wish to live: 
Yet ancient, noble ties draw th e careful thinker    10955 
From present things to t hose that follow after.  
I too, in time, must leave all I still hold dear, 
It’s your duty then to name a new ruler, here. 
At our holy altar, crow n and raise him high: 
What war begins ends peacefully, by and by.     10960  
The High-Chancellor 
 
With pride at heart, yet humble in gesture, too, 
We, the Earth’s noblest princes bow to you. 
So long as blood fills our loyal veins, then still Are we the body that obeys your every will. 
 
The Emperor 
 
Now, to conclude, let everyt hing we’ve enacted    10965 
Be set down for the future, as we’ve contracted. As Lords you hold your possessions, free in fact, With this condition, that  they remain intact. 
And what you have from us, whatever else is won, 
Shall descend in due measure to  the eldest son.    10970  
The High-Chancellor 
 
I’ll entrust it to parchment straight away, 
This weightiest statute to bless us, and the state: 
The Chancery will provide fair copy, and reveal 
You as confirmed, my Lords, by sign and seal.  
The Emperor 
 
And so I dismiss you that you may deliberate    10975 
Together, concerning this great day for our state. 
 
(The Secular Princes exit .) 
 
The Archbishop 
 
The Chancellor leaves, the Bishop remains here, 
With this grave warning to offer in your ear. 
His paternal heart, anxiously, fears for you.  
The Emperor 
 
Speak, in this happy hour, what care’s on view?    10980 
 
The Archbishop 
 
With what bitter pain I find that even at this hour, 
Your hallowed head still to ys with Satan’s power! 
True, you’ve secured the throne now, yet it seems, Sadly, scorning God, and the Pope’s great schemes. 
When he learns of it, swift punishment he’ll bring,    10985 
And destroy your sinful realm with holy lightning. He’s not forgotten how, at that earlier time, 
Of coronation, you freed the wizard: in crime. 
With your diadem, you injured Christianity, Striking a cursed head with the first act of mercy.    10990 Now beat your breast and from your guilty measure, 
Give back to the holy shrine a little treasure: 
You, taught humility, devote to  pious use, and good, The spacious stretch of hills where your tent stood. 
Where evil spirits gathered for your protection,    10995 
And the Prince of Liars secured your attention: 
Grant mount and forest deep , as far as they extend, 
And heights, the green sl opes adorn, without end. 
Clear lakes rich in fish, countless streams that flow, 
Winding swiftly, that rush to the valleys below:    11000 Then the broad vale itself , meadow, lawn and hollow: 
Show your remorse: gain th e mercy that must follow. 
 
The Emperor 
 
I’m deeply fearful of this, my heavy sin: 
Yourself, mark out the borders of the scheme.  
The Archbishop 
 
First then the place profaned by such sinfulness,    11005 
Dedicate that to the service of heavenliness. 
Thick walls rise quickly, at the mind’s desire, Already the sun’s dawn glance lights the choir, 
The growing building takes the cross’s structure, 
The nave long and high, a delight  to each believer:    11010 
Already as they press eag erly through the doors, 
A first peal rings through hills, down valley floors, 
From the high tower, that’s striving towards heaven, 
The penitent comes, to whom new life is given. That day of consecration – ma y it be soon! –     11015 
When your presence grants the greatest boon. 
 
The Emperor 
 
Let the pious mind proclaim so great an action, 
In praising the Lord, I’ll achieve my expiation. 
Enough! I already feel my mind’s exaltation. 
 
The Archbishop 
 
As Chancellor I require a formal proclamation.    11020 
 The Emperor 
 
A formal document: lay that before me,  
I’ll be pleased to sign wh atever the Church agrees. 
 
The Archbishop  (Has taken leave, but turns back at the door .) 
 At the same time devote th e total income of the land, 
As it arises, tithes, taxes, le vies, to the work on hand, 
Forever. It needs to be ma intained, fairly,     11025 
And its careful upkeep will cost us dearly. From all that plunder, grant us a measure of gold, 
To build it quickly there,  in that desert fold. 
Moreover we’ll need, I can’t help mentioning, Timber from far off, lime, slate, and such things.    11030 
Exhorted from the pulpit, the folk will haul it, 
The Church will bless the ma n who learns to serve it. 
 
(He exits .) 
 
The Emperor 
 
The sin with which my soul is heavy, is full sore: 
Wretched Sorcerers have wounded me, once more.  
The Archbishop (Returning, yet again, and bowing deeply .) 
 Pardon, my Lord! The Imperial shore was given    11035 
To that disreputable man, I’ll excommunicate him, 
Unless you in penitence grant the Church, there, too, Its tithes, and gifts, and taxe s: the whole of its revenue. 
 
The Emperor  (In a bad humour .) 
 
That land doesn’t exist, it lies there under the sea. 
 
The Archbishop 
 
Who’s patient, and is right, his time is yet to be.    11040 
For us, your word must wait on one man’s desire.  
(He exits .) 
 
The Emperor  (Alone .) 
 
I might as well sign away the whole wide empire. Part II Act V Scene I: Open Country 
 
The Wanderer 
 
Yes! Here are the dusky lindens, 
Standing round, in mighty age. 
And here am I, returni ng to them,      11045 
After so long a pilgrimage! It still appears the same old place: 
Here’s the hut that sheltered me, 
When the storm-uplifted wave, Hurled me shore-wards from the sea!      11050 
My hosts are those I would bless, 
A brave, a hospitable pair, Who if I meet them, I confess, 
Must already be white haired. 
Ah! They were pious people!       11055 Shall I call, or knock? – Greetings, 
If, as open-hearted, you still 
Enjoy good luck, in meetings!  
Baucis  (A little woman, very aged .) 
 Gentle stranger! Quietly, quietly! Peace! Let my husband rest!       11060 
Long sleep lends the elderly, 
Little time to work, at best.   
The Wanderer 
 
Tell me, Mother: are you that wife 
To whom thanks should be given: 
Who brought a young man back to life,     11065 When wife and husband worked as one? 
Are you that Baucis who tirelessly 
Restored my almost-vanished breath?  (Her husband appears .) 
 
Are you that Philemon, who bravely Saved my wealth from watery  death?       11070 
Your swiftly burning fire, 
Your silvery sounding bell, 
In chance, dread and dire, Was the outcome that befell. 
And now let me walk about,       11075 
And view the boundless ocean: Let me kneel, and be devout: Mind troubled with emotion. 
 
(He walks on, over the downs .) 
 
Philemon (To Baucis .) 
 Hurry now, and lay the table, 
Underneath the garden trees.       11080 
Let him go: as in the fable, He’ll not credit what he sees. 
 
(He follows, and stands beside the Wanderer .) 
 
Where wave on wave, foaming wildly, 
Savagely mistreated you, See a garden planted, widely,       11085 See the Paradisial view. 
I was too old to seize the day, 
Unfit to work as long ago: And while my powers ebbed away, 
The tide extended its wide flow.       11090 
Clever Lords set their bold servants Digging ditches, building dikes, 
To gain the mastery of ocean, 
Diminishing its natural rights. See green meadow bordering meadow,     11095 
Field and garden, wood and town. – 
But it’s time to eat, so follow, Sunset is approaching now. See the sails, far away there, 
Seeking port before the night.       11100 
The birds fly homeward through the air: Their harbour too heaves in sight. 
So gaze then, at the whole horizon, 
Where the blue sea used to flow, 
Right and left there, to your vision,      11105 Densely peopled space below. Part II Act V Scene II: In the Little Garden 
 
(The three of them at table .) 
 Baucis (To the stranger .) 
 
Are you dumb? And will you lift Not a morsel to your mouth?  
Philemon 
 
He wants to comprehend the gift: 
Tell him, freely then: speak out.       11110 
 
Baucis 
 
Well! It was a marvel, really! 
It troubles me to this day: 
Then its whole nature, surely, 
Was peculiar, in its way.  
Philemon 
 
Is the Emperor, then, at fault,       11115 
Who granted him the land? 
Didn’t a herald make his halt, 
Crying out what was planned? Not far away there, on the dunes, 
The first bold step was made,       11120 
Tents, huts! – And on the downs, A palace, quickly raised. 
 
Baucis 
 
For days, work rumbled on in vain, 
Pick and shovel, blow on blow: Where the night’s fires flamed,       11125 Next day a dam would follow. 
Human blood was forced to flow, 
At night, rose the sound of pain: The seaward floating fiery glow 
Was a canal, come dawn again.       11130 
He’s a godless man: he’d steal 
Our hut, and our few acres: But like subjects we must kneel, 
When we boast such neighbours. 
 
Philemon 
 
Yet he’s offered us another       11135 
Holding, on his new-won land!  
Baucis 
 
Never trust what’s built on water, 
On the heights maintain your stand. 
 
Philemon 
 
Let’s make our way to the chapel, 
To watch the last glow of light,       11140 
Kneel, pray, and sound the bell, 
And trust in God’s ancient might! Part II Act V Scene III: The Palace 
 
(Spacious pleasure-gardens : a broad straight canal. Faust in extreme old 
age, walking about, thoughtfully .) 
 
Lynceus, the Warder  (Through a speaking trumpet .) 
 The sun is fading, the last boats Sail swiftly to the harbour here. 
One large vessel gently floats,       11145 
Down the canal: and draws near. The bright flags flutter merrily, 
The masts are trimmed, in time: 
The boatmen all praise you gladly, Fortune celebrates your prime.       11150 
 
(The little bell on the dunes rings out .) 
 
Faust  (Startled .) 
 Accursed ringing! Wounding me 
With shame: a treacherous blow: 
My realm’s laid out there, endlessly, But, at my back, this vexes so, Proclaiming, with its jealous sound:      11155 
My great estate is less than fine, 
The old hut, all the trees around, The crumbling chapel, are not mine. 
And even if I wished to rest there, 
A strange shadow makes me  shudder,      11160 
It’s a thorn in my eye, and deeper: 
Oh! Would I were somewhere other! 
 The Warder  (From above .) 
 
The boat is sailing, brightly dressed, Towards us, on the evening breeze! Heaped, with boxes, sacks and chests,      11165 
From its journey on the seas! 
 (A splendid boat, richly and brigh tly loaded with foreign goods .) 
 
(Mephistopheles. The Three Mighty Warriors .) 
 
Chorus 
 
Here we land, 
Already, here. Hail to our Lord, 
Our patron dear!         11170 
 (They disembark: the goods are unloaded .) 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
We’ve proven ourselves in every way, 
Pleased, if we win our patron’s praise. We took two ships when we sailed before 
With twenty ships we dock, once more. 
What we’ve achieved, each fine thing,      11175 You’ll see from the cargo that we bring. 
The ocean’s freedom frees the mind 
There all thought is left behind! You only need a handy grip, You catch a fish, or take a ship,       11180 
And once you’re lord of all three, 
The fourth one’s tackled easily: The fifth one’s in an evil plight, 
You have the might, and so the right. 
You wonder what, and never how.      11185 I know a little of navigation: 
War, trade, and piracy, allow, 
As three in one, no separation. The Three Mighty Warriors 
 
No thanks for us! 
No thanks at all!         11190 As if we’ve brought  
A stench, that’s all. 
He pulls a  Nasty face again: These royal goods         11195 
Don’t please him then. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Don’t expect more 
Pay for it! 
What you’ve had 
Is what you get.         11200  
The Warriors 
 
That was only 
To pass the time: 
We want an equal Share in crime.  
Mephistopheles 
 
Then first set out in        11205 
Hall on hall, 
The costly treasures, One and all! 
And coming to 
The splendid show,        11210 He’ll think it all the  
More, you know, 
He won’t be mean, With you, at least, He’ll give the fleet,        11215 
Feast on feast. 
Tomorrow motley birds attend, I want to take good care of them. 
 
(The cargo is removed .) 
 (To Faust .) 
 
This splendid fortune you embrace With wrinkled brow, and gloomy face!     11220 Your noble wisdom has been crowned, 
Sea’s reconciled with solid ground: 
From the shore, on swifter track, The sea wills out the ship, and back: 
So speak, that here, from your spire,      11225 
Your arms might grip the world entire. From this place the trench was cut, 
Here stood the first wooden hut: 
A little ditch was traced from here, Where now vessels’ wakes appear.      11230 
Your servants’ toil, your thought so wise, 
Have won the Earth and Ocean’s prize. From here on – 
 
Faust 
              –  that accursed here! 
That always brings me wretched fear, 
To you who are so clever, I say it,      11235 
It gives my heart sting on sting, It’s impossible for me to bear it. 
I’m ashamed to even speak the thing. 
The old ones up there should yield, I want the limes as my retreat,       11240 
The least tree in another’s field, 
Detracts from my whole estate. There, to stand and look around, 
I’ll build a frame from bough to bough, 
My gaze revealing, under the sun,      11245 A view of everything I’ve done, Overseeing, as the eye falls on it, 
A masterpiece of the human spirit, 
Forging with intelligence, A wider human residence.       11250 
That’s the worst suffering can bring, 
Being rich, to feel we lack something. 
The bell’s chime, the lindens’ breeze, Like tombs in chur chyards stifle me. 
The exercise of my all-conquering will     11255 
Is shattered in the sand,  here, and lies still.  
How can I drive it from my nature! The bell peals, and I’m an angry creature. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
It’s natural! Intense frustration 
Drives a man to desperation.       11260 Who doubts it! That clang I fear 
Falls cruelly on a noble ear. 
And that wretched bing-bang-bong , 
Through the clear evening sky, that gong, 
Is joined to every chance event,       11265 
From first bath to last interment. As if between its bing and bong  
Life’s a dream, and then is gone. 
 
Faust 
 
Such obstinacy and opposition 
Diminishes the noblest position,      11270 Until in endless pain, one must 
Grow deeply weary of being just. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Why bother yourself so much about them? 
Shouldn’t you long ago have colonised them? Faust 
 
Then go and push them aside for me! –     11275 
You know the land, with my approval, Set aside for the old folks removal. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
We’ll take them up, and set them down, 
They’ll stand, once more: I’ll be bound: 
When they’ve survived a little force,      11280 They’ll be reconciled to it, of course. 
 
(He whistles shrilly .) 
 
Come: perform your Lord’s command! 
And tomorrow let the feast be planned.  
The Three Warriors 
 
This old Lord received us badly, 
A feast now is our right: believe me.      11285 
 Mephistopheles (To the audience .) 
 
And here we se e, as long ago 
Naboth’s vineyard  still on show. ( Kings I:21 )  Part II Act V Scene IV: Dead of Night 
 
Lynceus, the Warder (Singing on the watch-tower of the palace .) 
 For seeing, I’m born, 
For watching, employed, 
To the tower, I’m sworn,        11290 While the world, I enjoy. I gaze at the far, 
I stare at the near, 
The moon and the star, The forest and deer:        11295 
The eternally lovely 
Adornment, I view, And as it delights me 
I delight myself too. 
You, fortunate eyes,        11300 All you’ve seen, there, 
Let it be as it may, 
Yet it was so fair!  
(Pause .) 
 I’m not positioned here, on high,  Just for my own enjoyment:       11305 
What horror, meant to terrify, 
Threatens from the firmament! I see sparks of fire gushing 
Through the lindens’ double night, 
Fanned by the wind’s rushing,       11310 Ever stronger grows the light. 
Ah! Within, the hut is burning, 
Damp and mossy though it stand: Swift help, in this direction turning, 
Is needed, yet no aid’s to hand.       11315 
Ah! The pious old couple, So careful ever of the fire, Made a prey to smoke, to stifle, 
On this dreadful pyre! 
The flame burns on: glowing red, It’s now a blackened mossy pile:      11320 
If only those good folk are rescued, 
From those fires of hell, run wild! 
A bright tongue of lightning heaves, Through the branches, through the leaves:     11325 
Breaking, snapping, catching swiftly, 
Withered branches flicker, glow. Why have I such powers to see! Why are mine the eyes that know! 
The little chapel now collapses,       11330 
With the falling branches’ weight. Already with bright snakelike flashes, 
The treetops, gripped, meet their fate. 
Glowing crimson, to their hollow  Roots, the trunks now burn with ease. –     11335 
 
(A long pause. Chant .) 
 
What used to pleas e my eyes, below, 
Has vanished with the centuries.  
Faust  (On the balcony, towards the downs .) 
 What whining song is that, above? Too late its word and tone reach me. 
The watchman wails: yes, I’m moved:      11340 
Annoyed by this impatient deed. But let the lime-trees be erased, 
A horror now of half-burnt timber, 
A watchtower can soon be raised, To gaze around at boundle ss splendour.     11345 
From there I’ll see my new creation, 
One set aside for that old pair: at least,  They’ll feel benign consideration, 
Enjoying their last days in peace. 
 Mephistopheles and the Three Warriors  (Below .) 
 
Here we come, and at the double:      11350 
Pardon us! We’ve caused you trouble. We knocked, and knocked on the door, 
But it seemed locked for evermore: 
We rattled it, and shook it too, 
Until the planks broke in two:       11355 We called aloud, and threatened, then, 
But there was no reply, again. 
And as happens in such cases, They heard nothing, hid their faces: But we commenced without delay      11360 
To drive the stubborn folk away. 
That pair knew scant anxiety, They died of terror, peacefully. 
A stranger, who was hiding there, 
And wished to fight, we tried to scare.      11365 But in the fast and furious bout, 
From the coals that lay about, 
The straw took fire. Now all three, In that one pyre, burn merrily. 
 
Faust 
 
Were you deaf to what I said?       11370 
I wanted them moved, not dead. This mindless, and savage blow, Earns my curse: share it, and go! 
 
Chorus 
 
The ancient proverb says of course: 
Yield willingly to a greater force!      11375 While if you’re bold and opt for strife, 
You’ll stake your house, and home – and life. 
 (They exit .) 
 
Faust  (On the balcony .) 
 Stars hide their faces, and their glow, 
The fire sinks, and flickers low: 
A moist breeze fans the dying ember,      11380 Bringing smoke and vapour closer.  
Quickly said, too quickly done, I fear! – 
Now, what hovers like  a shadow, here? Part II Act V Scene V: Midnight 
 
(Four Grey Women enter .) 
 
The First 
 
I am called Want. 
 
The Second 
 
I am called Guilt. 
 
The Third 
 
I am called Care. 
 
The Fourth  
Necessity, I.       11385 
 
 
Three Together (Want, Guilt and Necessity ) 
 The door is shut tight, and we cannot get in: The owner is rich: he won’t have us within. 
 
Want 
 
I shrink to a shadow. 
 
Guilt 
 
                    To emptiest space. 
 
Need 
 
The wealthy from me turn  their pampered face. Care 
 
Sisters, you can’t enter, dare n’t enter there.     11390 
But, through the keyhole no w, always slips, Care. 
 
(Care disappears .) 
 
Want 
 
You, my Grey Sisters, take your flight too. 
 
Guilt 
 
Close by your side, I come following you. 
 
Necessity 
 
Close at your heels is Necessity’s breath. 
 
The Three 
 
The clouds there are moving, a nd cover the stars!    11395 
Behind us, behind us! From far, oh, from far, He’s coming, our Brother, he ’s coming, he’s – Death. 
 
Faust (In the Palace .) 
 I saw four: but only three went away: 
I caught no meaning from the words they say. 
It sounded as if I heard – ‘Necessity’s breath’,    11400 And then a gloomy rhyming word, like – ‘Death’. 
It rang hollow, ghostly, subdued, to me. 
Even now I’ve not won my liberty. If I could banish Sorcery from my track, 
Unlearn the magic-spells that  draw me back,     11405 
And stand before you, Na ture, as mere Man, 
It would be worth the pain of being Human.  So was I, a seeker in the darkness, 
Cursing both self and world, in wickedness. 
Now the air is filled with phantom shapes,     11410 It’s hard to see how anyone escapes. 
Though day may smile on us with rational gleams, 
The night entwines us in a web of dreams: 
We come happily from the fields of youth, 
A bird croaks: what? Misfortune: is our truth.    11415 
Cloaked with superstitions, soon and late: 
It’s wedded to us, warns us: shows our fate. And so, alone, intimidated, we stand. The door creaks, yet no one is at hand. 
 
(Anxiously .)  
 
Is anyone there?      
 
Care 
   The answer must be, yes!     11420 
 
Faust 
 
And you, who then are you? 
 
Care 
 
        I am your guest. 
 
Faust 
 
Be gone! 
 
Care 
 
             I am here, in my proper place. 
 Faust (First angered, then composed, addressing himself .) 
 
Take care: of magic spells show not a trace. Care 
 
Though the ear choose not to hear, 
In the heart I echo, clear:        11425 Savage power I exercise, 
Transformed I am, to mortal eyes. 
On the land, and on the ocean, Evermore the dr ead companion, 
Always found, and never sought,      11430 
Praised, as well as cu rsed, in thought. – 
Have you yourself not known Care?  
Faust 
 
I sped through the World that’s there: 
Gripped by the hair every appetite, 
And let go those that failed to delight,      11435 Let those fly that quite escaped me. 
I’ve desired, achieved my course, 
Desired again, and so, with force, Stormed through life: first powerfully, 
But wisely now: and thoughtfully.      11440 
Earth’s sphere’s familiar enough to me, The view beyond is barred eternally: The fool who sets his sights up there, 
Creates his own likeness in the air! 
Let him stand, and look ar ound him well:     11445 
This world means someth ing to the capable. 
Why does he need to roam eternity! 
Let him grasp what is firm reality. So let him wander down his earthly day: 
And if ghosts haunt him, go on his way,     11450 
Find joy and suffering in striding on, Dissatisfied with every hour that’s gone. Care 
 
When of man I take possession, 
Then his whole world is lessened: Endless gloom meets his eyes,       11455 
No more suns will set or rise, 
Though intact, to outer sense, He lives in the dark, intense, Never knowing how to measure 
Any portion of his treasure.       11460 
Good and ill are merely chance, He starves, food in his hands: 
Be it joy or be it sorrow 
He delays it till tomorrow, Waiting for the future, ever,       11465 
Finding his fulfilment, never. 
 
Faust 
 
Be gone! And don’t come near me! 
Such nonsense I’ll not understand. 
Away, with your evil litany, 
Sent to confuse the cleverest man!      11470  
Care 
 
Shall he come, or shall he go? 
All decision is denied him: 
In the middle of the road, 
He staggers, feeling round him. He’s ever more deeply lost,       11475 
Seeing everything star-crossed, 
Wearies himself and all the rest, Stifles as he holds his breath: 
Lifeless, but not yet gone under, 
Resists despair or surrender.       11480 So, with an incessant rolling, A painful end, and hard going, 
Now free, and now constrained, 
In half sleep, poorly entertained, Confine him in a little space:       11485 
Prepare him for Hell’s other place. 
 
Faust 
 
Unholy spectre! So you hand our race 
To the ravages of a thousand devils: Even transform our worthless days To a wretched knot of en tangling evils.     11490 
It’s hard I know to free oneself from Demons, 
The strong spirit-bonds are not lightly broken: And yet, Care, I’ll not recognise you, nor even, 
That creeping power of yours, by any token.  
 
Care 
 
Feel it now, as on the wind,       11495 
I, and my curse, depart, again.  
Lifelong, all you men are blind, 
Now, Faust, be so to the end!  
(She breathes in his face, and departs .) 
 Faust  (Now blind .) 
 
The night seems deeper all around me, 
Only within me is there gleaming light:     11500 I must finish what I’ve done, and hurry, 
The master’s word alone declares what’s right. 
Up from your beds, you slaves! Man on man! Reveal the daring of my favoured plan. 
Seize the tools: on with pick and spade!     11505 
Let the end-result be now displayed. Strict order, and swift industry 
Then the finest prize we’ll see: 
And so the greatest work may stand, One mind equal to a thousand hands.      11510 Part II Act V Scene VI: The Gr eat Outer Court of the Palace 
 
(Torches .) 
 Mephistopheles (In advance, as Overseer .) 
 
Come on! Come on! In here, in here! Quivering spirits of the dead, All you patchwork semi-natures, 
Sinew, bone, and tendon wed. 
 The Spirits of the Dead  (Lemures, in Chorus .) 
 
Swiftly now we are on hand       11515 With half an impression, 
That it concerns a tract of land, 
Of which we’ll gain possession. Pointed stakes with us appear, 
Chains to measure ground on:       11520 
But why you’ve called us here Is something we’ve forgotten. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Artistic effort’s not the prize: 
Carry it out in your own manner! 
Lay the longest one of you lengthwise,     11525 Then pile the turf on him, you others.  
Do as they once did for our fathers there, 
Dig out a somewhat lengthened square! Gone from a palace to a narrow place: 
It’s still as stupid an end for man to face.     11530 
 The Spirits of the Dead (Digging with mocking gestures .) 
 
When I was young and lived and loved, I thought it was very sweet: To happy sounds, and cheerful steps, 
I lifted up my feet. 
 Now treacherous old age has clawed      11535 
Me with his crutch, since when 
I stumble at the gr ave’s wide door, 
Why do they leave it open!  
Faust (Comes from the Palace, groping his way past the doorposts .) 
 How the clattering of shovels cheers me! It’s the crews still labouring on,       11540 
Till earth is reconciled to man, 
The waves accept their boundaries, And ocean’s bound with iron bands. 
 
Mephistopheles  (Aside .)  
 
And yet with all your walls and dams 
You’re merely dancing to  our tune:      11545 
Since you prepare for our Neptune, 
The Water-demon, one vast feast. 
You’ll be lost in every way – The elements are ours, today, 
And ruin comes on running feet.      11550 
 
Faust 
 
Overseer! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
  Here! 
 
Faust 
 
          Any way you can 
Bring crowds of labourers together, 
Spurred by force or hope of pleasure, By pay, enticement or press-gang! Report to me on progress every day,      11555 
The depth of earth and gravel dug away. 
 Mephistopheles (Half-aloud .) 
 
Reporting it to me the word they gave, 
Was not quite gravel, it was more like – grave.  
Faust 
 
A swamp lies there below the hill, Infecting everything I’ve done:       11560 
My last and greatest act of will 
Succeeds when that foul pool is gone. Let me make room for many a million, 
Not wholly secure, but free to work on. 
Green fertile fields, where men and herds     11565 May gain swift comfort fro m the new-made earth. 
Quickly settled in those hills’ embrace, 
Piled high by a brave, industrious race. And in the centre here, a Paradise, 
Whose boundaries hold back the raging tide,     11570 
And though it gnaws to enter in by force, The common urge unites to halt its course. 
Yes, I’ve surrendered to this thought’s insistence, 
The last word Wisdom ever has to say: He only earns his Freedom and Existence,     11575 Who’s forced to win them freshly every day. 
Childhood, manhood, age’s vigorous years, 
Surrounded by dangers, they’ll spend here. 
I wish to gaze again on such a land, 
Free earth: where a free race, in freedom, stand.    11580 
Then, to the Moment I’d dare say: ‘Stay a while! You are so lovely!’ 
Through aeons, then, never to fade away 
This path of mine through all that’s earthly. – Anticipating, here, its deep enjoyment,     11585 
Now I savour it, that highest moment. (Faust sinks back, the spirits of the dead take him and lay him on the 
ground .) 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
No bliss satisfied him, no enjoyment, 
And so he tried to catch at shifting forms: The last, the worst, the emptiest of moments, He wished to hold at last in his arms.      11590 
Though against me he tried to stand, 
Time is master: age lies on the sand.  The clock stands still – 
 
Chorus 
 
Stands still! As midnight: silent.  
The hand moves. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
It falls, and all is spent. 
 
Chorus 
 
It’s past. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
Past! A stupid word.       11595 
Then, why? Past, and pure nothing, complete monotony! 
What use is this eternal creation! 
Creating, to achieve annihilation! ‘There, it’s past!’ What’s to read in it?      11600 
It’s just the same as if it never lived, 
Yet chases round in circles, as if it did. I’d prefer to have the everlasting void. Burial 
 
A Spirit of the Dead (Solo.) 
 Who’s built the house so badly, 
With shovel and with spade?       11605 
 Spirits of the Dead  (Chorus .) 
 
For you dull guest, in hempen dress, 
It was all too carefully made.  
A Spirit of the Dead (Solo.) 
 Who’s decked the hall so badly? 
Where now the table and chairs? 
 Spirits of the Dead  (Chorus .) 
 
Borrowed for a little while:       11610 There are many creditors. 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
The body’s here: if the spirit tries to fly, 
I’ll show it my blood-signed title swiftly:  
Yet men have found so many methods, sadly, 
To cheat the Devil of their souls, or try.     11615 
We carry on the same old way, 
New ones aren’t recommended: I used to work alone: today 
I have to use the help extended. 
And everything goes badly too!       11620 Ancient right, traditional use, 
One can’t rely on those much longer. 
At the last breath, once, the soul was out, I slipped by, and like the swiftest mouse, Caught her! Held her fast, my cl aws were stronger.    11625 
Now she lingers, won’t leave the gloomy place,  
The foul corpse’s hideous house, until The elements force her, in hatred still, 
And drive her out at last, in disgrace. 
And though the hour and minut e plague me,     11630 
‘When’, ‘how’ and ‘where’, still the tiresome query: Old Death has lost his ancient power, 
‘Whether’ is doubtful, never mind the hour: 
Often, with lust, I saw the rigid frame It was a sham: it stirred, a nd rose again.     11635 
 
(He makes fantastic, whirling conjuring gestures .) 
 Now quick! Redouble your paces, too, 
You gentlemen, straight  or twisted-horned, 
The old Devil’s grain and kernel born, And bring Hell’s jaws along with you. 
True Hell has many jaws! Ye s, many!      11640 
To swallow according to standing and worth: However in this last game of all we’re ready 
To be a little less consid erate, henceforth.   
  (The fearful jaws of Hell open on the left .) 
 
The tusks yawn wide: th e jaws of the abyss, 
Flow with raging flames, in fury,      11645 And in the boiling background hiss, 
I see the eternal glow of the fiery city. 
The crimson tide breaks against the teeth, 
The damned in hope of help swim through: 
But the vast hyena mangles them beneath,     11650 
And sends them to new anguish in the brew. There are many corners to discover, 
So many horrors in such little room! 
You’ve done quite well at frightening sinners, But still they think it dream, deceit, untrue.     11655 
 
(To the fat devils with short straight horns .) 
 Now, you fat-bellied rascals with fiery cheeks! 
You’ve grown that way eating hellish sulphur:  
Stumpy, short, with thick immoveable necks! Watch below, for any glow of phosphor: 
That’s the soul, Psyche with the wings,     11660 
Pluck them off and she’s a nasty worm: 
I’ll stamp her with my signature, first thing, Then off with her to the whirling fiery storm! 
Pass on towards the nether regions, 
You barrels, since all that’s your duty:      11665 Whether she lives there, that’s the notion, None know with any accuracy. 
She’ll gladly lodge in the navel – 
Lest she slip away from  there, be careful. 
 
(To the lean devils with long crooked horns .) 
 You, clowns, you giant flying creatures,     11670 
Grasp at the air: grant yourselves no rest! 
Your strong arms and sharp-clawed features, 
Are sure to hold the fluttering fugitive fast. 
She’s stuck there inside her ancient house, 
And Spirit will always look for a way out.     11675  
(Glory from above, on the right .) 
 
The Heavenly Host 
 
Messengers follow 
Heavenly kin, oh, In leisurely flight: 
Sin they forgive, 
Dust they make live:        11680 The friendship they show 
To Nature below, 
Floating they’ll give, As they slowly alight! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
I hear discords, all that nasty jingling,      11685 
Coming from up there, w ith unwelcome day: 
It’s always that childish, girlish bungling, That pious taste loves to hear and play. 
You know how we in de spicable moments, 
Considered the ruin of the human race:     11690 
But the most shamef ul of compliments, 
Is that their prayers are a worse disgrace. 
These dandies come, the hypocrites: 
They’ve snatched a h eap of souls away, 
Use our own weapons too to do it:      11695 They’re Devils in disguise, I’d say. 
To lose this one is everlasting shame: 
On to the grave, and renew your claim! 
 
The Choir of Angels (Scattering roses ) 
 Roses, you dazzling ones, 
Balsam you’re sending us,       11700 
Floating and trembling, Secretly quickening, 
Branches inspiring us, 
Buds sweetly firing us, Hasten to bloom!         11705 
Crimson and green, here 
Springtime assume! Carry the sleeper To Paradise’ room. 
 
Mephistopheles (To the devils .) 
 
Why duck and dive? Is that Hell’s custom?     11710 
Stand still, and let them do their scattering. Every gawk in place, and face them! 
They think with such a flowery smattering, 
To cool the heat of devils’ chattering: At your breath it melts and shrinks, again.      11715 
Now blow, you blowers! – Enough, enough! 
Your bubbling’s faded all that stuff. – Not so fiercely! Close your mouths and noses! Ah, now you’ve been too violent with the roses, 
Where’s the moderation you s hould have learnt?    11720 
They’re not just shrivelling: they’re burning, burnt! They float about in flames, poisonous, bright: 
Avoid them: close together, huddle tight! – 
Your power’s waning! And your courage too! 
The devils sniff the strange, seductive brew.     11725  
The Choir of Angels  
 
Blossoms, of joyfulness, 
Flames, of true happiness, 
Love, they radiate, 
Bliss, they now create, As the heart may.         11730 
Words that are truest, 
Air of the clearest, Gathering round us 
Eternal day! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
O, curses! O shower of sham e that’s shed!     11735 
Each Satan’s standing on his head, 
The Fatties spin like tops, in curves, 
And plunge arse-upwards into Hell. Go find the hot baths you deserve! While at my post I’ll stand here still. –      11740 
 
(He beats at the hovering roses .) 
 
Will-o’-the wisps, be gone! Though you burn bright, 
Snatched at, in the end, you’re disgusting shite. Why’d you keep fluttering here? Buzz off! – 
They stick like tar and sulphur: filthy stuff. 
 
The Choir of Angels  
 
What is not part of you,        11745 
You need not share it: What inwardly troubles you, 
You need not bear it. 
Should it close in, with force, We will deflect its course.       11750 
Only the loving, Love 
Guides to its source! 
 
Mephistopheles 
 
My head and heart are bur nt: my liver’s burnt, 
By a devilish element!  Sharper than the fires of Hell! –       11755 
That’s what makes you cry, so, as well, 
You, the unlucky in love! Disdained, Heads turned to the beloved, strained. 
Mine, too! What’s twisted it to one side? 
Are they and I not sworn to eternal strife?     11760 I, once fiercely hostile to their very sight. 
Has an alien force pierced me through and through? 
I gladly gaze at them, loveliest of youths: What holds me back from cursing at the light? – 
And if I let myself be seduced,       11765 
Who’ll play the fool in future? These airy fellows that I hate, too, 
How lovely to me now they all appear! – 
You sweet children, tell me then: Aren’t you part of Lucifer’s race?      11770 You’re so nice I’d like to kiss you, and again, 
It feels as if this is your proper place. 
It feels as comfortabl e, as natural to me, 
As if we’d met a thousand times before: 
So surreptitiously catlike, so lustfully:      11775 
The loveliness with each  glance quickens more. 
Oh, come nearer: Oh, only glance at me! 
 
The Angels 
 
We’re here already, why so cautiously? 
We are close, and, if you can, then stay!  (The Angels come forward and  occupy the whole space .) 
 
 Mephistopheles  (Crowded into the proscenium .) 
 
You scorn us, the spirits of the damned,     11780 
Yet you’re of the true Sorcerers’ brand: You lead both man and wife astray. – 
What wretched luck, and dire! 
Is this Love’s own element? My whole body’s bathed in fire,      11785 I scarcely feel, my head’s so burnt. – 
You float to and fro, sink down a while, 
Move your sweet limbs with earthly guile: True, a grave expression suits you well, 
But I’d still like to see you smile a little!     11790 
That would be an eternal delight to me. Like the lovers’ mutual glance, you see: 
A simper round the mouth, is how it’s done, 
You, the tall lad, you c ould make me love you, 
The priest’s pose doesn’t really suit you,     11795 
So show a little lust, and look hereon! 
You could be more m odestly naked too, 
That robe’s long hem, so demure in its rising – 
They turn away – and s een from the rear view – 
Those rascals now are really appetising!     11800  
The Choir of Angels 
 
You, loving fires, Brighter, now, fanned, 
Heal the damned, 
With Truth, the higher! Let them be freed         11805 
From evil indeed, 
Blissfully grace, The eternal embrace. Mephistopheles  (Collecting himself .) 
 
What’s happening to me! – Like Job, in fact 
All boils: so I scare myself, and yet I’ve won     11810 As well, since, now my inspection’s done, 
And my trust in self and tribe’s well placed, 
The Devil’s noble bits  appear intact, 
This love-bewitchment’s only on the surface: The wretched flames already smother,      11815 
And, as is right, I curse you all together! 
 
The Choir of Angels 
 
Pure incandescence! 
Whom its flames bless, 
Blissful with goodness, 
Is their existence.         11820 Gathered together, 
Rise now, and praise! 
Spirit can breathe here, In purer waves! 
 
(They rise, carrying away the immortal part of Faust .) 
 Mephistopheles  (Looking round him .) 
 
How then? – Where did they vanish to?     11825 You took me by surprise, you adolescents. 
Now with what they’ve salvaged from the tomb, 
As their own prize, they’ve flown off to heaven: They’ve stolen a great, a unique treasure: 
That noble soul, mortgaged to my pleasure,     11830 
They’ve snatched it aw ay, with cunning even. 
But whom could I complain to, anyway? 
Who’d grant me my well-earned right? 
You’ve been swindled in your old age, You’ve deserved it, this wretched slight.     11835 At great expense, shameful! And it’s gone: 
I’ve mishandled it all disgracefully, 
A common lust, an absurd passion, Swayed the hardened devil foolishly. 
And if Experience was in a mess,      11840 
With all these childish, stupid things, 
It was, in truth, no trivial Foolishness, That took possession of him in the end. Part II Act V Scene VII: Mountain  Gorges, Forest, Rock, Desert 
 
(Holy Hermits, divided in ascending  planes, posted among the ravines .) 
 
Chorus and Echo 
 
Forests, they wave around, 
Over them, cliffs bear down,         11845  
Roots cling to rocky ground, 
Trunk upon trunk is bound, 
Wave after wave sprays up, Deep caves protecting us. 
Lions prowl silently,        11850 
Round us, still friendly, Honouring sacred space, 
Love’s holy hiding place. 
 Pater Ecstaticus  (Hovering up and down .) 
 
Eternal, fire of bliss, Glow of love’s bond this is,       11855 
Pain in the heart, seething, 
Rapture divine, foaming. Arrows, come, piercing me, Spears, compelling me, 
Clubs, you may shatter me,       11860 
Lightning may flash through me! So passes the nullity 
Of all unreality, 
And from the lasting star Shines Love’s eternal core.       11865 
 
Pater Profundis (At a lower level .) 
 
As this rocky abyss at my feet, 
Rests on a deeper abyss, As a thousand glittering streams meet In the foaming flood’s downward hiss, 
As with its own strong impulse, above,     11870 
The tree lifts skywards in the air: Even so all-powerful love, 
Creates all things, in its care. 
Around me there’s a savage roar, 
As if the rocks and forests sway,      11875 Yet full of love the waters pour, 
Rushing bountifully away, 
Sent to irrigate the valley here: The lightning that flashed down, Must purify the atmosphere,       11880 
With poisonous vapours bound – 
They are love’s messengers, they tell Of what creates eternally around us. 
May it inflame me inwardly, as well, 
Since my spirit, cold and confounded,      11885 Torments itself, bound in the dull senses, 
As sharp-toothed fetters’ agonising art. 
Oh, God! Calm my thoug hts, pacify us,  
And bring light to my needy heart! 
 
Pater Seraphicus  (In the middle regions .) 
 
What a mist of morning hovers       11890 
Through the pine-trees’ swaying hair! Can I guess what it might cover? A crowd of spirits live there. 
 
Choir of Sacred Young Boys 
 
Tell us, Father, where we wander, 
Tell us, Kind One, who we are?       11895 We are happy: Being’s tender 
To all who are, all who are. 
 
Pater Seraphicus 
 
Young boys! Born at midnight’s hour, 
Mind and spirit half-unveiled, For your parents, a lost dower,       11900 
For the angels, profit gained. 
You can feel that one who loves Is near to you, so come to me: 
Yet of earthly ways and moves, 
You bear no traces, happily.        11905 
Rise into my eyes, those known Organs of the earthly life, 
You can use them as your own, 
Gaze at all the spaces wide!  (He absorbs them into himself .) 
 
Those are trees: those are cliffs,       11910 A stream of water,  rushing round, 
With gigantic leaps it lifts, 
Shortening its journey down.    
The Young Boys  (From within him .) 
 That’s indeed a mighty vision, 
But it’s gloomy here, you know,      11915 
With fear and dread we’re all shaken. Father, Kind one, let us go! 
 
Pater Seraphicus 
 
Rise upwards to the highest sphere, 
Grow unnoticed there forever, 
While in pure eternal manner,       11920 God’s presence makes you stronger. 
Such is the spirit’s libation, 
Blending with the freest air: Love’s eternal revelation, 
Bliss is unfolded there.        11925 
 The Choir of Young Boys (Circling round the highest summit .) 
 
Hands now entwining, Joyfully circling round, Soaring and singing 
With sacred feeling’s sound! 
In the divinely taught,        11930 Now you should trust: 
He whom your worship sought 
You’ll see at last. 
 The Angels  (Soaring in the highest atmosphere, carrying the immortal part 
of Faust .) 
 He’s escaped, th is noble member 
Of the spirit world, from evil,       11935 
Whoever strives, in his endeavour, 
We can rescue from the devil. And if he has Love within, 
Granted from above, 
The sacred crowd will meet him,      11940 With welcome, and with love. 
 
The Younger Angels 
 
Every rose from the hands 
Of those penitents, loving, holy, Helped us win the victory, 
The highest work, completed, stands,      11945 
The treasure of this soul we’ve won. Evil bowed to petals thrown, Devils fled the blows we threw. 
Instead of Hell’s hurts anew, 
They felt spirits’ loving pain:       11950 Pierced with agony again 
The old devil-master too was gone. 
Shout with joy! All is done.  
The More Perfect Angels 
 
Carrying earthly remains 
Is hard to endure,         11955 
Though they survive the flames, They are still the impure. Once a great spirit’s strength 
So tightly fits 
All the four elements,        11960 No angel splits 
That double nature wed, 
The inwardly binding: 
To Eternal Love instead Is left the unwinding.        11965 
 
The Younger Angels 
 
Misted on rocky heights 
Now we are feeling, 
Nearing our clearer sight Spiritual Being. 
These clouds are vanishing       11970 
A crowd I see, moving, Of sacred young men, 
Freed from their earthly gloom, 
Circling together, Delighting again,         11975 
In the spring’s brighter bloom, 
In higher air. Let them together then, 
Lead him on: risen, 
Perfect, and there!         11980  
The Young Boys 
 
Joyfully we receive Him as a chrysalis: 
So that we now achieve 
A pledge of our bliss. Let all the threads be lost        11985 
That now surround him! 
He is already blessed, Divine Love has found him. 
 
Doctor Marianus (The transformed Faust : in the highest purest cell .) 
 Here is the freest view, 
Of spirit borne skywards.        11990 
There women moving too Drifting on upwards. 
The splendour I see within 
Garlands of stars, 
There, all the Heavens’  Queen       11995 
Shines from afar. 
 
(Enraptured .) 
 Highest Queen of all the world! 
Let me, in the blue, 
With all heaven’s web unfurled, Know your mystery too.        12000 
Approve the tender, serious, 
Stir of the human heart, And in love’s sacred bliss, 
Raise it higher, through your art. 
Our courage is unconquerable       12005 When you command on high: 
But our glow is gentler, still, 
When you are satisfied. Virgin, pure, of loveliest mind, 
Mother, in all nobility,        12010 
Peer to everything divine, Queen of our reality. Such light cloud fragments 
Wind all around her, 
They are the penitents,        12015 Women so tender, 
All around her knees, 
Breathing the air, free, Desiring her mercy. 
You are the Virginal Mother,       12020 
It’s not surprising Those seduced by another 
Towards you are rising. 
Taken in weakness now, They are all harder to save:       12025 Who can resist the power 
Of desires that enslave? 
How quickly the feet may slip On smooth, sloping ground! 
Who’s un-tempted by glance and lip,      12030 
Or by flattering sounds? 
 (The Mater Gloriosa soars into space .) 
 
Choir of Female Penitents 
 
You soar, on high, now, 
Towards the eternal realm, 
Hear our pleading, though, You, the peerless one,        12035 
Oh, merciful one! 
 Magna Peccatrix  (The sinful woman who anointed Christ’s feet , See Luke 
vii:36 ) 
 By the love that at the feet there 
Of your son, divine, transfigured, 
Let the tears like balsam flow there, Despite the Pharisees’ derision:       12040 
By the vessel, that so richly 
Spread its fragrance on the ground, By the locks of hair that softly Dried the holy feet, shed round – 
 
The Woman of Samaria  (The woman at the well, See John iv ) 
 
By the well, where once before       12045 
Abraham’s flocks were driven, By the jar, that cooled the Saviour, 
That to sacred lips was given: 
By the pure and flowing fountain, That poured out its clear water,       12050 
Overflowing, bright and certain, 
Through all the worlds, forever.  Mary of Egypt (Acta Sanctorum ) 
 
By the consecrated place Where the Lord’s body lay: 
By the warning arm, against my face,      12055 
That thrust me far from the doorway: 
By my forty years’ repentance, Faithful, in that desert land: 
By the blissful final sentence 
That I wrote there on the sand –       12060 
 
All Three 
 
Since you offer your presence 
To the worst sinner, 
The prize of penitence 
Soars upwards forever, Begrudge not this true soul,       12065 
Who, this once, transgressed, 
Not knowing she might fall, Commensurate forgiveness! 
 
A Penitent, Formerly Named Gretchen (Stealing closer .) 
 
Oh, bow down, 
You peerless one,         12070 You radiant one, Your face, in mercy, towards my bane! 
My true beloved, 
No longer clouded, Returns to me again.        12075 
 
The Sacred Young Boys  (Nearing, hovering in circles .) 
 
With mighty limbs, already 
He is beyond us there, Returning to us, so richly, 
The rewards of our care. 
We were taken early        12080 Out of life’s chorus: Yet he’s learned, so he 
Will gently teach us. 
  
The Penitent, Formerly Named Gretchen  
 
Changed to himself, he’s scarce aware 
Of the spirits’ noble choir all around,      12085 
He hardly knows his new life, there, 
Already he’s so like the sacred crowd. See, how he’s thrown off every bond  Of his old earthbound integument, 
And his first youth now’s re-found,      12090 
It shines through his ethereal garment. Allow me to teach him, here, 
The new light still blinds him so. 
 
The Mater Gloriosa 
 
Come! Rise towards the higher spheres! Gaining awareness of you, he  will follow.     12095 
 
Doctor Marianus  (Bowing, in adoration .) 
 
Gaze towards that saving gaze, 
All you, the penite nt and tender, 
To all those blissful ways, Give thanks, and follow after. 
Let every finer sense, unseen,       12100 
Be offered to her service, Virgin, Mother now, and Queen, 
Goddess, grant your mercies! 
 
The Mystic Choir 
 
All of the transient, 
Is parable, only:         12105 
The insufficient, 
Here, grows to reality: The indescribable, Here, is done: 
Woman, eternal,         12110 
Beckons us on.
